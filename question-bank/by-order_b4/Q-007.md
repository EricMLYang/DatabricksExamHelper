# Question 7

## Question
A data engineer is noticing that a large UC-managed Delta table (≈750GB) has become slow when applying intensive CDC feeds.




Which of the following actions should the data engineer take to improve the performance?

## Options
- A. Enable deletion vectors on the table and apply Z-order indexing on the primary keys. 
- B. Partition the table and apply Z-order indexing on the primary keys. 
- C. Partition the table and apply liquid clustering using the primary keys. 
- D. Enable deletion vectors on the table and apply liquid clustering using the primary keys. (Correct)

## Explanation
Since Change Data Capture (CDC) involves processing updates and deletions, to improve the performance of a large Delta table experiencing slow CDC feeds, the data engineer should enable deletion vectors on the table and apply liquid clustering using the primary keys.




Enabling deletion vectors allows Delta to efficiently track and manage rows that are deleted or updated without requiring full rewrites of the underlying files, which significantly reduces the overhead for CDC operations. Applying liquid clustering on the CDC merging keys organizes the data physically based on these keys, ensuring that related records are colocated and minimizing the amount of data scanned during updates and deletions. Together, these optimizations help maintain high ingestion and query performance, reduce latency for CDC workloads, and make the table more manageable at scale.
