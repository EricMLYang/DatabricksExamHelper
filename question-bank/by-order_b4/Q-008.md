# Question 8

## Question
The data engineering team has a secret scope named "prod-scope" that contains sensitive secrets in a production workspace.




A data engineer in the team is writing a security and compliance documentation, and wants to explain who could use the secrets in this secret scope. 




Which of the following roles is able to use the secrets in the specified secret scope ?

## Options
- A. Workspace Administrators 
- B. Users with READ or MANAGE permission on the secret scope 
- C. Secret creators 
- D. All the mentioned roles are able to use the secrets in the secret scope (Correct)

## Explanation
Administrators*, secret creators, and users granted access permission can use Databricks secrets. The secret access permissions are as follows:



- 

MANAGE - Allowed to change ACLs, and read and write to this secret scope.
- 

WRITE - Allowed to read and write to this secret scope.
- 

READ - Allowed to read this secret scope and list what secrets are available.




Each permission level is a subset of the previous level's permissions (that is, a principal with WRITE permission for a given scope can perform all actions that require READ permission).




* Workspace administrators have MANAGE permissions to all secret scopes in the workspace.
