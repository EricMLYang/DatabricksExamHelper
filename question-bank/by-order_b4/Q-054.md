# Question 54

## Question
The data engineering team created a new Databricks job for processing sensitive financial data. A financial analyst asked the team to transfer the "Owner" privilege of this job to the "finance" group.




A junior data engineer that has the "CAN MANAGE" permission on the job is attempting to make this privilege transfer via Databricks Job UI, but it keeps failing.




Which of the following explains the cause of this failure?

## Options
- A. Having the "CAN MANAGE" permission is not enough to grant "Owner" privileges to a group. The data engineer must be the current owner of the job. 
- B. Groups can not be owners of Databricks jobs. The owner must be an individual user. (Correct)
- C. Having the "CAN MANAGE" permission is not enough to grant "Owner" privileges to a group. The data engineer must be a workspace administrator. 
- D. The "Owner" privilege is assigned at job creation to the creator and cannot be changed. The job must be re-created using the "finance" group's credentials. 

## Explanation
A job cannot have a group as an owner. If you try to set a group as the owner of a job, you get the error "Groups can not be owners"
