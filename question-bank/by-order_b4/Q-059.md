# Question 59

## Question
A data engineer manages a Delta Lake table with liquid clustering enabled. They understand that liquid clustering operates incrementally, but they are unsure how to trigger the clustering operation when new data is ingested into the table.




Which of the following commands should be executed to cluster the newly added data?

## Options
- A. VACUUM 
- B. OPTIMIZE (Correct)
- C. ZORDER

## Explanation
To cluster the newly added data in a Delta Lake table with liquid clustering enabled, the data engineer should execute the OPTIMIZE command. OPTIMIZE triggers the clustering operation by physically reorganizing the data files to improve query performance.
