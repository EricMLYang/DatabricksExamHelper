# Question 9

## Question
A data engineer is responsible for managing a bronze Delta Lake table in Unity Catalog. As part of maintaining data integrity and enforcing governance policies, the engineer wants to restrict modifications to the table by disabling UPDATE and DELETE operations.




Which of the following commands can the data engineer use to enforce this restriction?

## Options
- A. ALTER TABLE bronze_raw SET TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.disableUpdate' = true, 'delta.disableDelete' = true); 
- B. ALTER TABLE bronze_raw SET TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.disableUpdate' = true);

ALTER TABLE bronze_raw SET TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.disableDelete' = true); 
- C. ALTER TABLE bronze_raw SET TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.preventModification' = true); 
- D. ALTER TABLE bronze_raw SET TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.appendOnly' = true); (Correct)

## Explanation
The data engineer can disable UPDATE and DELETE operations on the bronze Delta Lake table by setting the table to append-only mode, which prevents modifications while still allowing inserts. The correct command for this is:

`ALTER TABLE bronze_raw SET TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.appendOnly' = true);`




`delta.appendOnly` is the recognized Delta Lake property to disallow updates and deletes, whereas the other options are not valid Delta table properties.
