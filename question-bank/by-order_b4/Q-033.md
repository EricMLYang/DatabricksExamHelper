## Question
Which of the following source locations can no longer be used to store init scripts?

- D. Volumes 

## Explanation
As of recent Databricks updates, DBFS (Databricks File System) can no longer be used to store init scripts. Databricks has deprecated the use of DBFS root (/dbfs/) for storing cluster init scripts due to reliability and security concerns.

- 

Volumes
- 

Cloud storage
- 

Workspace files
