# Question 44

## Question
Which of the following privileges is not included in the ALL PRIVILEGES permission?

## Options
- A. MANAGE (Correct)
- B. BROWSE 
- C. EXECUTE 
- D. MODIFY 

## Explanation
The privilege MANAGE is not included in the ALL PRIVILEGES permission. While ALL PRIVILEGES grants a comprehensive set of permissions such as EXECUTE, BROWSE, and MODIFY, it explicitly excludes MANAGE to prevent accidental data exfiltration or privilege escalation.




Remember, MANAGE allows a user to view and manage privileges, transfer ownership, drop, and rename an object. It is similar to object ownership, but holding the MANAGE privilege does not automatically grant all other privileges on the object, although the user can grant themselves additional privileges if needed.
