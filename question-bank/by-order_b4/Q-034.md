# Question 34

## Question
"A declarative ETL framework for implementing incremental data processing, while minimizing operational overhead and maintaining table dependencies and data quality."




Which of the following technologies is being described above?

## Options
- A. ETL 
- B. DAB 
- C. DBU 
- D. LDP (Correct)

## Explanation
The technology described is LDP (Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines). LDP is a declarative ETL framework specifically designed to handle incremental data processing efficiently while minimizing operational overhead. It supports automatic orchestration that ensures dependencies between tables are properly managed, and maintains high data quality throughout the pipeline.




Unlike traditional ETL pipeline development that often requires procedural coding and manual orchestration, LDP allows users to define data transformations and workflows declaratively, making pipelines easier to maintain, scale, and monitor.




Note: Databricks has recenlty open-sourced this solution, integrating it into the Apache Spark ecosystem under the name Spark Declarative Pipelines (SDP).
