# Question 30

## Question
A data governance team notices that different business units have implemented their own versions of masking policies on the same columns. How does Unity Catalog improve this situation?

## Options
- A. It provides a single source of truth for masking functions, preventing inconsistent exposure. (Correct)
- B. It allows teams to disable masking for testing purposes, providing more flexibility during development. 
- C. It allows teams to leverage data object privileges to mask data differently for different groups. 
- D. It lets each team manage its version of masking rules, increasing control over data privacy. 

## Explanation
Unity Catalog improves this situation by providing a single source of truth for masking functions, ensuring that all business units use consistent and centrally governed masking policies across the same data columns.




In Unity Catalog, masking logic can be implemented and managed as user-defined functions (UDFs), which encapsulate the masking rules in reusable and standardized code. This means that instead of each team creating its own version of a masking rule—potentially leading to inconsistent or insecure data handling—a single, validated UDF can be registered and referenced by all teams. As a result, Unity Catalog enforces consistent data governance, enhances compliance, and reduces the risk of inconsistent exposure of sensitive information across the organization.
