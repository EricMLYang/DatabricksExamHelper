# Question 48

## Question
A data engineer is using the Query Profile in Databricks SQL to investigate a slow-performing SQL query. They want to find out which operations in the query are taking the most time.




Which section of the Query Profile highlights the most expensive operations in the query, helping to identify potential optimization opportunities?

## Options
- A. Top operators (Correct)
- B. Aggregated task time 
- C. Query status 
- D. Query wall-clock duration 

## Explanation
The correct answer is Top operators. In Databricks SQL, the Top operators section of the Query Profile highlights the most expensive operations within a query by showing which specific operations (such as joins, scans, or aggregations) are consuming the most time. This allows the data engineer to pinpoint performance bottlenecks and focus on optimizing the parts of the query that have the highest impact on overall execution time.
