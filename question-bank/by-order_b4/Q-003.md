# Question 3

## Question
A data engineer wanted to create the job 'process-sales' using Databricks REST API.




However, they sent by mistake 2 POST requests to the endpoint 'api/2.2/jobs/create'




Which statement describes the result of these requests ?

## Options
- A. 2 jobs will be created in the workspace, but the second one will be renamed to "process-sales (1)" 
- B. The second job will overwrite the previous one created using the first request. 
- C. 2 jobs named "process-sales" will be created in the workspace, but with different job_id (Correct)
- D. Only the first job will be created in the workspace. The second request will fail with an error indicating that a job named "process-sales" is already created. 

## Explanation
Sending the same job definition in multiple POST requests to the endpoint 'api/2.2/jobs/create' will create a new job for each request, but each job will have its own unique job_id.
