# Question 32

## Question
A multinational company wants to share sales analytics data with both its internal Databricks teams located in a different country and external consulting partners. Internal teams access the data via Databricks-to-Databricks sharing (D2D), while external partners use the open Delta Sharing (D2O) protocol.




In this scenario, how does authentication differ between the D2D sharing and the D2O protocol?

## Options
- A. Databricks-to-Databricks sharing (D2D) and open Delta Sharing (D2O) both use the same authentication method, so there is no difference. 
- B. Databricks-to-Databricks sharing (D2D) relies on OIDC federation, whereas open Delta Sharing (D2O) requires authentication via bearer tokens. 
- C. Databricks-to-Databricks sharing (D2D) relies on unified login with single sign-on (SSO), whereas open Delta Sharing (D2O) uses external login with OIDC federation. 
- D. Databricks-to-Databricks sharing (D2D) uses built-in authentication with no token exchange, whereas open Delta Sharing (D2O) requires external authentication via bearer tokens or OIDC federation. (Correct)

## Explanation
Databricks-to-Databricks sharing (D2D) uses built-in authentication with no token exchange, allowing internal teams to access shared data seamlessly within the Databricks environment, whereas open Delta Sharing (D2O) requires external authentication, typically via bearer tokens or OIDC federation, to securely grant external partners access to the data.
