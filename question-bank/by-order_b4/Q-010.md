# Question 10

## Question
Two junior data analysts are collaborating on a data analytics project using a Databricks notebook. Currently, they are relying on the built-in notebook versioning feature within Databricks to manage changes and maintain some level of version control. While this approach works for small-scale, individual work, the team faces challenges when multiple people are editing notebooks simultaneously. Observing this, a senior data engineer suggested that they consider using Git folders for source control instead of relying solely on the notebook's built-in versioning system.




Which of the following reasons could explain why Git folders are recommended over Databricks notebook versioning for collaborative team work?

## Options
- A. Git folders support creating and managing branches for development work, which helps prevent accidental overwrites and allows multiple team members to work on features simultaneously. (Correct)
- B. Git folders provide AI-generated code suggestions by analyzing the contributions and coding patterns of other team members, helping developers write compatible code. 
- C. Git folders ensure that the team always has the latest notebook version by automatically synchronizing all project notebooks without requiring any commits or pushes. 
- D. Git folders support resolving merge conflicts automatically, making it faster to integrate contributions from different team members without constant manual intervention. 

## Explanation
The main reason Git folders are recommended over Databricks notebook versioning for collaborative teamwork is that Git folders support creating and managing branches for development work. In practice, each team member creates their own Git folder linked to the same remote Git repository and works within their personal branch, so changes can be made independently without impacting others. This approach prevents accidental overwrites and allows multiple team members to work on features simultaneously, enabling proper version control and structured collaboration.
