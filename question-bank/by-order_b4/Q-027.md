# Question 27

## Question
The data engineering team has a table 'orders_backup' that was created using Delta Lake's SHALLOW CLONE functionality from the table 'orders'. Recently, the team started getting an error when querying the 'orders_backup' table indicating that some data files are no longer present.




Which of the following correctly explains this error ?

## Options
- A. The VACUUM command was run on the orders table (Correct)
- B. The OPTIMIZE command was run on the orders table 
- C. The OPTIMIZE command was run on the orders_backup table 
- D. The VACUUM command was run on the orders_backup table 

## Explanation
With Shallow Clone, you create a copy of a table by just copying the Delta transaction logs.

That means that there is no data moving during Shallow Cloning.

Running the VACUUM command on the source table may purge data files referenced in the transaction log of the clone. In this case, you will get an error when querying the clone indicating that some data files are no longer present.
