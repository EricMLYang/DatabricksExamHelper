# Question 1

## Question
A data engineering team manages Unity Catalog tables with predictive optimization enabled. They are unsure which operations are automatically performed on these tables as part of predictive optimization's automatic maintenance.




Which of the following operations is Not handled automatically by predictive optimization for enabled tables?

## Options
- A. VACUUM 
- B. ANALYZE 
- C. OPTIMIZE 
- D. ZORDER (Correct)

## Explanation
Z-order indexing is not handled automatically by predictive optimization for Unity Catalog tables. While predictive optimization can automatically manage the OPTIMIZE, ANALYZE, and VACUUM tasks to maintain table performance, it does not execute ZORDER, and any Z-ordered files are ignored when predictive optimization runs.
