# Question 51

## Question
A data engineer has an existing Databricks job and wants to manage it using Databricks Asset Bundles. They have already generated the YAML definition of the job and downloaded its referenced artifacts. However, they want to ensure that updates to the bundle's YAML will modify the existing job rather than creating a new job.




Which of the following commands allows the data engineer to achieve this?

## Options
- A. databricks bundle deployment match <bundle_job> <remote-job-id> 
- B. databricks bundle deployment link <bundle_job> <remote-job-id> 
- C. databricks bundle deployment mirror <bundle_job> <remote-job-id> 
- D. databricks bundle deployment bind <bundle_job> <remote-job-id> (Correct)

## Explanation
The correct command is `databricks bundle deployment bind <bundle_job> <remote-job-id>`, as this links the existing remote job to a defined resource in the Databricks Asset Bundle, ensuring that any updates to the bundle's YAML definition will modify the linked job rather than creating a new one.
