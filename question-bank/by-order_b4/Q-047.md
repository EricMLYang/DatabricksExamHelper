# Question 47

## Question
A data engineer has defined the following data quality constraint in a LDP pipeline:




`CONSTRAINT valid_id EXPECT (id IS NOT NULL) _____________`




Which clause correctly fills in the blank to immediately stop execution when a record violates this constraint?

## Options
- A. ON VIOLATION FAIL UPDATE (Correct)
- B. ON VIOLATION STOP 
- C. ON VIOLATION DROP ROW 
- D. ON VIOLATION FAIL PIPELINE 

## Explanation
The correct clause to fill in the blank is `ON VIOLATION FAIL UPDATE`, as this ensures that any record violating the `valid_id` constraint prevents the update from proceeding. This enforces strict data quality and prevents downstream processing of invalid records.




In this case, manual intervention is required before reprocessing. When a pipeline fails because of an expectation violation, you must decide how to handle the invalid data correctly before re-running the pipeline.




Note that this expectation causes a failure of a single flow and does not cause other flows in your pipeline to fail.
