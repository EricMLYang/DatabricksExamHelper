# Question 15

## Question
A data engineer has the following Databricks Asset Bundle (DAB) project:



```

- resources:
-     apps:
-         bookstore_app:
-             name: "bookstore_demo"
-             source_code_path: ../src/bookstore
-  
-     volumes:
-         bookstore_volume:
-             name: "bookstore"
-             catalog_name: demo_catalog
-             schema_name: demo_schema
-             grants:
-                 - principal: ${resources.apps.bookstore_app.id}
-                 privileges:
-                     - READ_VOLUME
-                     - WRITE_VOLUME
```





Which of the following correctly describes the result of deploying this DAB project?

## Options
- A. It deploys a Volume bookstore_volume and a Service Principal bookstore_app with read and write access to the Volume. 
- B. It generates an error because the reference `${resources.apps.bookstore_app.id}` is incorrect and should instead be `${resources.apps.bookstore_demo.id}`. 
- C. It deploys a Catalog demo_catalog, a Schema demo_schema, a Volume bookstore_volume, and a Databricks App bookstore_app with access to the volume using a 3-level namespace. 
- D. It deploys a Databricks App bookstore_app and a Volume bookstore_volume, and grants the Service Principal associated with the Databricks App read and write access to the Volume. (Correct)

## Explanation
When this Databricks Asset Bundle (DAB) project is deployed, it successfully creates two resources: a Databricks App named bookstore_app (with the display name "bookstore_demo") and a Volume named bookstore_volume within the specified catalog demo_catalog and schema demo_schema.




The configuration includes a grant statement that correctly references the app's identifier using `${resources.apps.bookstore_app.id}`, which ensures that the Service Principal associated with the deployed Databricks App is automatically given both READ_VOLUME and WRITE_VOLUME privileges on the created volume. This means the app's service identity can read from and write data to the bookstore volume as part of its operational workflow.
