# Question 14

## Question
Which of the following Databricks CLI commands allows a data engineer to list all runs of a job that completed successfully?

## Options
- A. databricks jobs list-runs --job-id <job-id> --success-only 
- B. databricks jobs list-runs --job-id <job-id> --completed 
- C. databricks jobs list-runs --job-id <job-id> --success 
- D. databricks jobs list-runs --job-id <job-id> --completed-only (Correct)

## Explanation
The correct Databricks CLI command that allows a data engineer to list all runs of a job that completed successfully is:




`databricks jobs list-runs --job-id <job-id> --completed-only.`




The --completed-only parameter is the proper flag to include only completed runs in the results; otherwise, the command will list both active and completed runs.
