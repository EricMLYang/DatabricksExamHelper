# Question 40

## Question
A data engineering team at an enterprise organization has recently completed the setup of a new Databricks Asset Bundle project. After successfully configuring the bundle with their CI/CD system, the team wants to ensure that future automated deployments to the production environment run smoothly and reliably.




In this scenario, which of the following commands should the CI/CD pipeline avoid rerunning during subsequent deployments?

## Options
- A. databricks bundle deploy 
- B. databricks bundle run 
- C. databricks bundle validate 
- D. databricks bundle init (Correct)

## Explanation
The CI/CD pipeline should avoid rerunning the databricks bundle init command during subsequent deployments because it is only used once to initialize a new Databricks Asset Bundle project by creating its configuration and structure. Re-running it could overwrite existing configurations or reset the project setup. In contrast, commands like databricks bundle validate, databricks bundle deploy, and databricks bundle run are safe and appropriate for repeated use in automated deployment pipelines to validate, deploy, and execute workflows as part of regular CI/CD operations.
