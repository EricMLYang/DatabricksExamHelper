# Question 35

## Question
In Spark UI, which of the following SQL metrics is displayed on the query's details page?

## Options
- A. Succeeded Jobs 
- B. Query execution time 
- C. Query duration 
- D. Spill size (Correct)

## Explanation
In Spark UI, the query's details page displays general information about the query execution time, its duration, the list of associated jobs, and the query execution DAG.




In addition, it shows SQL metrics in the block of physical operators. The SQL metrics can be useful when we want to dive into the execution details of each operator. For example, "number of output rows" can answer how many rows are output after a Filter operator, "Spill size" which is the number of bytes spilled to disk from memory in the operator.
