# Question 17

## Question
Which of the following Spark functions is NOT valid for extracting the date from a timestamp column?

## Options
- A. TO_DATE(ts) 
- B. date_part('day', ts) (Correct)
- C. CAST(ts AS DATE) 
- D. date_trunc('day', ts) 

## Explanation
The valid Spark functions for extracting the date from a timestamp column are:

- 

CAST(ts AS DATE) – This converts a timestamp to a date by dropping the time portion.
 Example: '2025-10-21 15:42:30' becomes '2025-10-21'.



- 

TO_DATE(ts) – This extracts only the date portion from a timestamp.
 Example: '2025-10-21 15:42:30' becomes '2025-10-21'.



- 

date_trunc('day', ts) – This function truncates a timestamp to the start of the specified unit.
 Example: If ts = '2025-10-21 15:42:30', then date_trunc('day', ts) returns '2025-10-21 00:00:00'.


In contrast, date_part can return a numerical component (e.g., day = 21) rather than converting to a full date type.
