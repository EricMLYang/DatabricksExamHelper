# Question 21

## Question
A data engineering team created a new workspace, which is automatically enabled for Unity Catalog. They observed that it contains a default workspace catalog and a default schema.




Which of the following statements correctly describes the default privileges that workspace users have on this catalog and schema?

## Options
- A. Workspace users have `ALL PRIVILEGES` on the default schema, along with `USE CATALOG` on the workspace catalog. 
- B. Workspace users primarily have `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE VOLUME`, `CREATE FUNCTION`, and `USE SCHEMA` privileges on the default schema, along with `USE CATALOG` on the workspace catalog. (Correct)
- C. Workspace users do not have any privileges on the default schema by default, unless the workspace administrator explicitly grants them the necessary permissions. 
- D. Workspace users have `ALL PRIVILEGES` on the workspace catalog. 

## Explanation
When a new workspace is created with Unity Catalog enabled, Databricks automatically provisions a default workspace catalog and a default schema, and assigns users a set of basic privileges that allow them to perform common data engineering tasks within that schema.




Workspace users have the USE CATALOG privilege on the workspace catalog, and specific privileges on the default schema, including:
- 

CREATE TABLE
- 

CREATE VOLUME
- 

CREATE FUNCTION
- 

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW
- 

CREATE MODEL
- 

USE SCHEMA
