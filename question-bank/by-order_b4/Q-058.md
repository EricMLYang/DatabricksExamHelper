# Question 58

## Question
A data engineer is tasked with enabling analysts and data scientists to query tables stored in an external PostgreSQL database directly from Databricks, without moving or replicating the data. They plan to use Lakehouse Federation and Unity Catalog to set up a foreign catalog for seamless access to the external data.




What is the very first step the data engineer should take in this process?

## Options
- A. Configure a connection in Unity Catalog to securely connect to the PostgreSQL database, establishing the necessary credentials and network access. (Correct)
- B. Navigate to the account console as an account administrator to enable the option "Allow Delta Sharing with parties outside your organization" 
- C. Grant CREATE SHARE and CREATE RECIPIENT permissions on the metastore to the metastore administrators. 
- D. Configure an external location and storage credentials in Unity Catalog to securely connect to the PostgreSQL's underlying storage. 

## Explanation
The very first step the data engineer should take is to configure a connection in Unity Catalog to securely connect to the PostgreSQL database, establishing the necessary credentials and network access. This is essential because before creating any foreign catalogs, Databricks needs a secure, authenticated connection to the external PostgreSQL database to allow seamless querying without moving the data.
