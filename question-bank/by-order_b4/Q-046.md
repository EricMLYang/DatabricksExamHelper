# Question 46

## Question
Which of the following statements correctly describes the SQL/DataFrame tab in Spark UI?

## Options
- A. It presents an in-depth view of all stages, showing their dependencies, task execution times, shuffle read/write metrics, and the distribution of tasks across worker nodes, giving insight into stage-level performance. 
- B. It shows all RDDs and DataFrames that are cached or persisted in memory and on disk, along with their sizes, storage levels, and block locations, helping users monitor memory usage and optimize caching strategies. 
- C. It shows the executed operations, including their query plans, execution metrics, physical and logical plans, DAG visualizations, stage and task breakdowns, and performance statistics for monitoring and debugging. (Correct)
- D. It provides a list of all the Spark jobs that have been submitted, including details about their start and end times, status, associated stages, and task metrics, allowing users to drill down into individual task performance 

## Explanation
The SQL/DataFrame tab in Spark UI is specifically focused on Spark SQL and DataFrame operations for debugging, monitoring, and understanding complex workloads. It provides a detailed view of queries, including:
- 

Logical and physical query plans
- 

DAG visualizations of operations
- 

Metrics for execution stages and tasks
- 

Performance statistics for debugging and monitoring queries




The other options describe different tabs in Spark UI:
- 

Spark Jobs tab: It provides a list of all the Spark jobs that have been submitted, including details about their start and end times, status, associated stages, and task metrics, allowing users to drill down into individual task performance
- 

Stages tab: It presents an in-depth view of all stages, showing their dependencies, task execution times, shuffle read/write metrics, and the distribution of tasks across worker nodes, giving insight into stage-level performance.
- 

Storage tab: It shows all RDDs and DataFrames that are cached or persisted in memory and on disk, along with their sizes, storage levels, and block locations, helping users monitor memory usage and optimize caching strategies.
