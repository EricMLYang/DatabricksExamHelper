## 題目內容

### 題幹

A small company based in the United States has recently contracted a consulting firm in India to implement several new data engineering pipelines to power artificial intelligence applications.

All the company's data is stored in regional cloud storage in the United States.

The workspace administrator at the company is uncertain about where the Databricks workspace used by the contractors should be deployed.

Assuming that all data governance considerations are accounted for, which statement accurately informs this decision?

### 選項

- **A.** Databricks runs HDFS on cloud volume storage; as such, cloud virtual machines must be deployed in the region where the data is stored.
- **B.** Databricks workspaces do not rely on any regional infrastructure; as such, the decision should be made based upon what is most convenient for the workspace administrator.
- **C.** Cross-region reads and writes can incur significant costs and latency; whenever possible, compute should be deployed in the same region the data is stored.
- **D.** Databricks leverages user workstations as the driver during interactive development; as such, users should always use a workspace deployed in a region they are physically near.
- **E.** Databricks notebooks send all executable code from the user's browser to virtual machines over the open internet; whenever possible, choosing a workspace region near the end users is the most secure.
