## 題目內容

### 題幹

The data engineering team has configured a Databricks SQL query and alert to monitor the values in a Delta Lake table. The recent_sensor_recordings table contains an identifying sensor_id alongside the timestamp and temperature for the most recent 5 minutes of recordings.

The below query is used to create the alert:

```sql
SELECT MEAN(temperature), MAX(temperature), MIN(temperature)
FROM recent_sensor_recordings
GROUP BY sensor_id
```

The query is set to refresh each minute and always completes in less than 10 seconds. The alert is set to trigger when mean(temperature) > 120. Notifications are triggered to be sent at most every 1 minute.

If this alert raises notifications for 3 consecutive minutes and then stops, which statement must be true?

### 選項

- **A.** The total average temperature across all sensors exceeded 120 on three consecutive executions of the query
- **B.** The recent_sensor_recordings table was unresponsive for three consecutive runs of the query
- **C.** The source query failed to update properly for three consecutive minutes and then restarted
- **D.** The maximum temperature recording for at least one sensor exceeded 120 on three consecutive executions of the query
- **E.** The average temperature recordings for at least one sensor exceeded 120 on three consecutive executions of the query
