## 題目內容

### 題幹

A Databricks job has been configured with 3 tasks, each of which is a Databricks notebook.

Task A does not depend on other tasks. Tasks B and C run in parallel, with each having a serial dependency on task A.

If tasks A and B complete successfully but task C fails during a scheduled run, which statement describes the resulting state?

### 選項

- **A.** All logic expressed in the notebook associated with tasks A and B will have been successfully completed; some operations in task C may have completed successfully.
- **B.** All logic expressed in the notebook associated with tasks A and B will have been successfully completed; any changes made in task C will be rolled back due to task failure.
- **C.** All logic expressed in the notebook associated with task A will have been successfully completed; tasks B and C will not commit any changes because of stage failure.
- **D.** Because all tasks are managed as a dependency graph, no changes will be committed to the Lakehouse until all tasks have successfully been completed.
- **E.** Unless all tasks complete successfully, no changes will be committed to the Lakehouse; because task C failed, all commits will be rolled back automatically.
