# Question 19

## Question
The data engineering team has a Delta Lake table created with following query:



```

- CREATE TABLE customers_clone
- AS SELECT * FROM customers
```





A data engineer wants to drop the table with the following query:




`DROP TABLE customers_clone`




Which statement describes the result of running this drop command ?

## Options
- A. The table will not be dropped until VACUUM command is run 
- B. Both the table's metadata and the data files will be deleted (Correct)
- C. An error will occur as the table is deep cloned from the customers table 
- D. Only the table's metadata will be deleted from the catalog, while the data files will be kept in the storage 

## Explanation
The table is created without the LOCATION clause, which means that it's a managed table. Managed tables are tables whose metadata and data are managed by Databricks.

When you run DROP TABLE on a managed table, both the metadata and the underlying data files are deleted.
