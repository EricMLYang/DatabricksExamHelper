# Question 21

## Question
A data engineer uses the dynamic reference `{{job.start_time.iso_datetime}}` to configure the value of a task parameter in a job.




Which of the following statements correctly describes the timezone of the returned timestamp?

## Options
- A. The timestamp is based on the workspace cloud region's local time. 
- B. The timestamp is based on the cluster virtual machine's local time. 
- C. The timestamp is in UTC. (Correct)
- D. The timestamp is based on the user's local time who triggered the job. 

## Explanation
In Databricks jobs, all time-based references are based on a timestamp in the UTC timezone, including: `is_weekday`, `iso_weekday`, `iso_datetime`, and `iso_date`.




This ensures consistency across regions, clusters, and users regardless of their local time zones.
