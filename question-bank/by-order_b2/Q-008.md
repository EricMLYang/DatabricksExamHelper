# Question 8

## Question
A data engineer wants to store passwords securely in a Unity Catalog managed table. They need to hash user passwords using `SHA2(password, 256)` before storing them. To ensure proper storage, the engineer must also set a constraint on the column length to accommodate the full hash value.




The engineer tests hashing the passwords "spark123" and "ApacheSpark111".




What will the engineer notice about the resulting hash lengths?

## Options
- A. Both hashes will have the same length, regardless of input size (Correct)
- B. Both hashes will have the same length because hash length depends on the number of numeric characters 
- C. The hash of "spark123" will be shorter than the hash of "ApacheSpark111" 
- D. The hash of "ApacheSpark111" will be shorter than the hash of "spark123" 

## Explanation
The reason both hashes have the same length comes from how cryptographic hash functions are designed. SHA-256 always produces a 256-bit output, no matter how long or short the input is. This is a fundamental property of cryptographic hash functions—they map inputs of arbitrary size to a fixed-length output.




Whether you hash "spark123" (8 characters) or "ApacheSpark111" (14 characters), SHA-256 will still generate 256 bits, typically represented as 64 hexadecimal characters. When represented as a hexadecimal string (which is standard for storing hashes), a 256-bit hash is always 64 characters long.




`SELECT sha2('spark123', 256);`

`SELECT sha2('ApacheSpark111', 256);`

As you can see, both the hash of "spark123" and the hash of "ApacheSpark111" have the same length, which is 64 hexadecimal characters. So, for the data engineer in this question, the column constraint should be set to accommodate 64-character.
