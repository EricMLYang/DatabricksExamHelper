# Question 51

## Question
Given the following multi-task job







If there is an error in the notebook 1 that is associated with Task 1, which statement describes the run result of this job ?

## Options
- A. Task 1 will completely fail. Tasks 2 and 3 will run and succeed 
- B. Task 1 will completely fail. Tasks 2 and 3 will be skipped 
- C. Task 1 will partially fail. Tasks 2 and 3 will be skipped (Correct)
- D. Task 1 will partially fail. Tasks 2 and 3 will run and succeed 

## Explanation
If a task fails during a job run, all dependent tasks will be skipped.




The failure of a task will always be partial, which means that the operations in the notebook before the code failure will be successfully run and committed, while the operations after the code failure will be skipped.
