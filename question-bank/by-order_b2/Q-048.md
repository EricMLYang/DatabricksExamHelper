# Question 48

## Question
Which of the following statements best describes dynamic file pruning in Apache Spark?

## Options
- A. An optimization technique that dynamically repartitions files into smaller chunks at runtime to balance workload across executors. 
- B. An optimization technique that skips reading irrelevant data files during query execution based on runtime filter information. (Correct)
- C. An optimization technique that automatically compresses large files during Spark job execution to prune storage usage. 
- D. An optimization technique that duplicates data files across worker nodes to improve data locality and query performance. 

## Explanation
Dynamic file pruning in Apache Spark is an optimization technique that skips reading irrelevant data files during query execution by leveraging runtime filter information, which allows Spark to avoid scanning files that do not match the query predicates, thereby improving performance and reducing I/O.
