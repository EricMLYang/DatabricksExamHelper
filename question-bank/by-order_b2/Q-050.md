# Question 50

## Question
A financial services firm manages highly sensitive client investment portfolios in Oracle databases and maintains its transactional market data in Microsoft SQL Server. Due to HIPAA regulations, data must remain in place and not be duplicated or exported unnecessarily. However, internal audit teams need to generate unified reports across both systems in Databricks while maintaining tight access control.




What solution should the data team use to enable direct querying to these databases without duplicating the data?

## Options
- A. Delta Sharing 
- B. Lakehouse Federation (Correct)
- C. Partner Connect 
- D. Shallow clone 

## Explanation
Lakehouse Federation is a feature in Databricks that enables users to query data in external databases directly, such as Oracle and SQL Server, without the need for data replication, ingestion, or movement. It provides a unified analytics layer on top of multiple data sources and allows for federated queries, where data from various platforms can be combined into a single logical view.




This aligns perfectly with the firm's needs
