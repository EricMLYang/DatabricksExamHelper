# Question 11

## Question
A data engineer at a retail company shared a large Delta table with an external analytics company using Delta Sharing without history. However, the company noticed slow performance when querying the shared data.




A senior data engineer suggested using the following command to share the data with history in order to improve query performance:

`ALTER SHARE sales_share ADD TABLE products WITH HISTORY;`




Which benefit is achieved by using WITH HISTORY?

## Options
- A. It leverages temporary security credentials from the cloud storage, scoped-down to the root directory of the provider's shared Delta table. (Correct)
- B. It replicates the table to balance query requests through the Delta Sharing server. 
- C. It performs a shallow clone of the table to share only the table's transaction log. 
- D. It leverages disk caching of the Delta Sharing server, resulting in performance that is comparable to direct access to source tables. 

## Explanation
Databricks-to-Databricks table shares can improve performance by enabling history sharing using the WITH HISTORY clause. Sharing history improves performance by leveraging temporary security credentials from your cloud storage, scoped-down to the root directory of the provider's shared Delta table, resulting in performance that is comparable to direct access to source tables.
