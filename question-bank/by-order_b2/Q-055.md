# Question 55

## Question
A junior data engineer has been tasked with implementing data quality validation in a Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline (LDP). They added several expectation functions to ensure that incoming datasets meet certain criteria before being processed further. After the junior engineer submitted a pull request, a senior data engineer began reviewing the code and noticed that one of the function calls used for validation was not correct.




As part of the review, the senior engineer wants to ensure that all expectation functions used in the pipeline are valid according to Databricks documentation.




Which of the following function calls is Not a valid expectation function in Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines?

## Options
- A. dlt.expect 
- B. dlt.expect_or_warn (Correct)
- C. dlt.expect_or_drop 
- D. dlt.expect_or_fail 

## Explanation
dlt.expect_or_warn is not a supported expectation function in Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines (LDP).




LDP supports the following expectation functions:
- 

dlt.expect: it writes invalid rows to the target (warning semantics)
- 

dlt.expect_or_drop: drops invalid rows before writing to the target.
- 

dlt.expect_or_fail: fails the update if violation occurs




Note: Databricks has recenlty open-sourced this solution, integrating it into the Apache Spark ecosystem under the name Spark Declarative Pipelines (SDP).
