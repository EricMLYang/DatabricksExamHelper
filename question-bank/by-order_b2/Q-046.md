# Question 46

## Question
A data engineer is working on a project that requires integrating data from an external API into a Databricks workspace. For security reasons, they decided not to hardcode the API key directly in their notebooks. Instead, they used Databricks Secrets to securely store and manage sensitive credentials, as follows:



```

- databricks secrets create-scope api_scope
- databricks secrets put-secret api_scope api_key
```





They now want to read the API key in order to query the external API endpoint from a Databricks notebook.




Which of the following code lines allows the data engineer to achieve this task?

## Options
- A. api_key = dbutils.secrets.read("api_scope", "api_key") 
- B. api_key = dbutils.secrets.get("api_scope", "api_key") (Correct)
- C. api_key = dbutils.secrets.read("api_key", "api_scope") 
- D. api_key = dbutils.secrets.get("api_key", "api_scope") 

## Explanation
`dbutils.secrets.get(SCOPE, KEY)` is used to securely retrieve a secret where the first argument is the scope name (api_scope) and the second argument is the secret key (api_key).
