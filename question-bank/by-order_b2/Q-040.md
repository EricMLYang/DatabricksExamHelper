# Question 40

## Question
A data engineer is responsible for managing and orchestrating data workflows in their organization's Databricks environment. They have deployed a job called events_process_job using Databricks Asset Bundles. To execute this job, the engineer runs the following command from their terminal:




`databricks bundle run events_process_job`




After observing the command, a senior data engineer suggests that they could improve the execution process by adding the `-t` option when running the command.




Which of the following explain the primary purpose of this option?

## Options
- A. To trigger dry run of the job without actually processing data 
- B. To enable temporary logging during job execution 
- C. To select the target environment for the job run (Correct)
- D. To specify the target cluster size for the job run 

## Explanation
The primary purpose of the -t option in the databricks bundle run command is to select the target environment for the job run.




When a data engineer runs a job using Databricks Asset Bundles, the -t (or --target) flag allows them to specify which environment—such as development, staging, or production—the job should execute in.




`databricks bundle run events_process_job -t prod`




This helps ensure that jobs run against the correct resources and datasets for that environment, avoiding accidental changes or processing in the wrong context, and streamlines deployment workflows across multiple environments.
