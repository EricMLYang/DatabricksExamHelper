# Question 10

## Question
Which of the following statements best describes deletion vectors in Delta Lake?

## Options
- A. Temporary files that store deleted rows until they are archived in a separate table partition called "_deletion_log". 
- B. Metadata structures that track which rows in a data file have been logically deleted without physically rewriting the file. (Correct)
- C. Indexes that accelerate queries on deleted rows by storing their physical locations directly in Unity Catalog volumes. 
- D. Data structures that permanently remove deleted rows from all data files in a Delta Lake table. 

## Explanation
In Delta Lake, deletion vectors are a performance optimization feature introduced to handle row-level deletes and updates efficiently.
- 

Instead of rewriting entire Parquet files when some rows are deleted or updated, deletion vectors keep track of which rows in a data file are logically deleted.
- 

This tracking is done through metadata structures stored separately from the data files.
- 

Queries automatically skip these deleted rows, even though the original Parquet files remain unchanged.


This significantly improves performance for frequent DELETE, UPDATE, and MERGE operations.
