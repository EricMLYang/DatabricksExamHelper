# Question 34

## Question
Which of the following Delta Sharing implementations support sharing Unity Catalog Volumes, Unity Catalog Models, and notebooks in addition to static Delta tables?

## Options
- A. None of the listed options support sharing these assets 
- B. Customer-managed implementation of the open-source Delta Sharing server 
- C. Databricks open sharing protocol 
- D. Databricks-to-Databricks sharing protocol (Correct)

## Explanation
The Databricks-to-Databricks sharing protocol is the only Delta Sharing implementation that supports sharing not just static Delta tables, but also additional Unity Catalog assets such as Volumes, Models, and Notebooks. This protocol extends the open Delta Sharing standard, enabling seamless collaboration and governance between Databricks workspaces and organizations within the Databricks ecosystem.




In contrast, the open Delta Sharing protocol and customer-managed implementations of the open-source Delta Sharing server are limited to sharing static Delta tables only. They do not support Unity Catalog assets or Databricks-native objects beyond data tables.
