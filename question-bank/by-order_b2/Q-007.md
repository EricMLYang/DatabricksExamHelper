# Question 7

## Question
The data engineering team maintains a Delta Lake table of SCD Type 1. A junior data engineer noticed a folder named '_change_data' in the table directory, and wants to understand what this folder is used for.




Which of the following describes the purpose of this folder ?

## Options
- A. CDF feature is enabled on the table. The '_change_data' folder is the location where CDF data is stored (Correct)
- B. The '_change_data' folder is the default directory to track the evolution in schema definition 
- C. Optimized Writes feature is enabled on the table. The '_change_data' folder is the location where the optimized data is stored 
- D. All SCD Type 1 tables have the '_change_data' folder to track the updates applied on the table's data. 

## Explanation
Databricks records change data for UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE operations in the _change_data folder under the table directory.




The files in the _change_data folder follow the retention policy of the table. Therefore, if you run the VACUUM command, change data feed data is also deleted.
