# Question 16

## Question
A data engineering team is managing a Delta Lake table called orders. They want to ensure that they can access the table's historical data using time travel for the same duration as Delta Lake's default transaction log retention.




Which of the following commands meet this requirement?

## Options
- A. ALTER TABLE orders SET TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.deletedFileRetentionDuration' = 'interval 90 days") 
- B. ALTER TABLE orders SET TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.deletedFileRetentionDuration' = 'interval 30 days") (Correct)
- C. ALTER TABLE orders SET TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.deletedFileRetentionDuration' = 'interval 7 days") 
- D. ALTER TABLE orders SET TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.deletedFileRetentionDuration' = 'interval 365 days") 

## Explanation
Delta Lake's default transaction log retention period is 30 days, which determines how long historical data is kept available for time travel before being permanently deleted. To match this retention period for the deleted data files, we need to alter the table to set the table property 'delta.deletedFileRetentionDuration', as follows:




`ALTER TABLE orders SET TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.deletedFileRetentionDuration' = 'interval 30 days")`
