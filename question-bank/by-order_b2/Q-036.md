# Question 36

## Question
The data engineering team wants to create a multiplex bronze Delta table from a Kafka source. The Delta Table has the following schema:




key BINARY, value BINARY, topic STRING, partition LONG, offset LONG, timestamp LONG




Since the "value" column contains Personal Identifiable Information (PII) for some topics, the team wants to apply Access Control Lists (ACLs) at partition boundaries to restrict access to this PII data.




Based on the above schema and the specified requirement, which column is a good candidate for partitioning?

## Options
- A. timestamp 
- B. key 
- C. partition 
- D. topic (Correct)

## Explanation
Table partitioning helps improve security. You can separate sensitive and nonsensitive data into different partitions and apply different security controls to the sensitive data.




* Personally Identifiable Information or PII represents any information that allows identifying individuals by either direct or indirect means, such as the name and the email of the user.
