# Question 39

## Question
A data engineer is testing a transformation pipeline that adds a new column to an existing DataFrame. They want to ensure the resulting DataFrame matches the expected output.




Which of the following functions can a data engineer use to verify equality?

## Options
- A. verifyEquality(actual_df, expected_df) 
- B. assert(actual_df = expected_df) 
- C. assertDataFrameEqual(actual_df, expected_df) (Correct)
- D. assertEqual(actual_df, expected_df) 

## Explanation
In PySpark, to verify the equality of two DataFrames, the correct function to use is `pyspark.testing.assertDataFrameEqual(actual, expected)`. This function compares the two DataFrames element-wise, checking for exact equality by default. It allows for optional parameters to control the comparison behavior, such as `ignoreColumnOrder` and `ignoreNullable`. If the DataFrames do not match, the function raises a `PySparkAssertionError` and provides a detailed diff of the differences.
