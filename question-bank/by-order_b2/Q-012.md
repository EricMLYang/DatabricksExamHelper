# Question 12

## Question
A data engineer has defined the following data quality constraint in a LDP pipeline:




`CONSTRAINT valid_id EXPECT (id IS NOT NULL) _____________`




Which clause correctly fills in the blank so records violating this constraint will be written to the target table, but reported in metrics?

## Options
- A. ON VIOLATION WARNING 
- B. There is no need to add the ON VIOLATION clause. By default, records violating the constraint will be kept, and reported as invalid in the pipeline metrics. (Correct)
- C. ON VIOLATION NULL 
- D. ON VIOLATION ADD ROW 

## Explanation
By default, records that violate the constraint will still be written to the target table and reported as invalid in the pipeline metrics. Therefore, the constraint can simply be defined as `CONSTRAINT valid_id EXPECT (id IS NOT NULL)` without any `ON VIOLATION` clause.




Note: Databricks has recenlty open-sourced this solution, integrating it into the Apache Spark ecosystem under the name Spark Declarative Pipelines (SDP).
