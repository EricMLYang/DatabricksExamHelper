# Question 3

## Question
Given the following Structured Streaming query:



```

- (spark.readStream
-         .table("orders")
-     .writeStream
-         .option("checkpointLocation", checkpointPath)
-         .table("Output_Table")
- )
```





Which of the following is the trigger Interval for this query ?

## Options
- A. Every half second (Correct)
- B. Every half min 
- C. Every half hour 
- D. The query will run in batch mode to process all available data at once, then the trigger stops. 

## Explanation
By default, if you don't provide any trigger interval, the data will be processed every half second. This is equivalent to trigger(processingTime="500ms")
