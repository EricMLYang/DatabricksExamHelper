# Question 57

## Question
Which of the following is considered a limitation when using the MERGE INTO command?

## Options
- A. Merge can not be performed if multiple source rows matched and attempted to modify the same target row in the table (Correct)
- B. Merge does not support records deletion. It supports only upsert operations. 
- C. Merge can not be performed in streaming jobs unless it uses Watermarking 
- D. Merge can not be performed if single source row matched and attempted to modify the multiple target rows in the table 

## Explanation
Merge operation can not be performed if multiple source rows matched and attempted to modify the same target row in the table. The result may be ambiguous as it is unclear which source row should be used to update or delete the matching target row.




For such an issue, you need to preprocess the source table to eliminate the possibility of multiple matches.
