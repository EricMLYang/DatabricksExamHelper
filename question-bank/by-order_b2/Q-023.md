# Question 23

## Question
A data engineer repaired a failed multi-task job run in Databricks. Before clicking Repair run, they changed a task parameter value in the Repair run dialog.




Which of the following best describes the effect of this change?

## Options
- A. The updated parameter applies only to the current repair run and does not modify the job's stored parameters. (Correct)
- B. The updated parameter value is permanently saved to the job configuration. 
- C. The repair run will fail because this feature only supports adding new parameters, not updating existing ones. 
- D. The change is ignored because the job parameters always override the run's parameters. 

## Explanation
In Databricks, when you use the "Repair run" for a failed job, the dialog allows you to tweak parameters for that specific run. These changes do not overwrite the job's original configuration. They only apply to this repair run.








To make the parameter change permanent, you need to update the job's configuration itself.
