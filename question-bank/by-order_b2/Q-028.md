# Question 28

## Question
Which of the following methods does Not allow data engineers to create a multi-task job in Databricks?

## Options
- A. Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs) 
- B. Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines (Correct)
- C. Workspace UI 
- D. REST API 

## Explanation
The method that does not allow data engineers to create a multi-task job in Databricks is Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines. Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines are meant for defining transformation logic in a declarative way (SQL/Python) and can function as a single task within a job rather than creating multi-task jobs themselves.




While the Workspace UI and REST API let you define jobs with multiple tasks, and Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs) can package and deploy multi-task job definitions.
