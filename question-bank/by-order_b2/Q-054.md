# Question 54

## Question
A data engineering team wants to ensure that a specific Python library is available every time a cluster starts.




Which approach best achieves this goal?

## Options
- A. Install the library when running a Python notebook 
- B. Use an init script to install the library during cluster startup (Correct)
- C. Manually install the library on the driver node each time the cluster starts 
- D. Use Databricks CLI to upload the library files to the cluster after startup 

## Explanation
The best approach is use an init script to install the library during cluster startup, because init scripts run automatically whenever the cluster starts, ensuring the Python library is consistently installed on all nodes before any jobs or notebooks execute, whereas manual installation, per-notebook installation, or uploading files post-startup are error-prone, inconsistent, and require extra manual steps.
