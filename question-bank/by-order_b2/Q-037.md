# Question 37

## Question
Which of the following correctly orders the Lakeflow Declarative pipeline permissions from least privilege to most privilege?

## Options
- A. CAN VIEW → CAN RUN → CAN MANAGE (Correct)
- B. CAN RUN → CAN VIEW → CAN MANAGE 
- C. CAN MANAGE → CAN VIEW → CAN RUN 
- D. CAN VIEW → CAN MANAGE → CAN RUN 

## Explanation
In permission hierarchies, least privilege to most privilege means starting with the minimal access and ending with full control.



- 

CAN VIEW: allows only viewing pipeline details, Spark UI, and driver logs.
- 

CAN RUN: allows executing the pipeline but not modifying it.
- 

CAN MANAGE: allows full control, including executing, editing, deleting, and managing permissions.




The same concept applies to job permissions.









Note: Databricks has recenlty open-sourced this solution, integrating it into the Apache Spark ecosystem under the name Spark Declarative Pipelines (SDP).
