# Question 13

## Question
For production Structured Streaming jobs, which of the following retry policies is recommended to use?

## Options
- A. Unlimited Retries, with 1 Maximum Concurrent Run (Correct)
- B. Unlimited Retries, with Unlimited Concurrent Runs 
- C. No Retries, with 1 Maximum Concurrent Run 
- D. No Retries, with Unlimited Concurrent Runs 

## Explanation
In order to restart streaming queries on failure, it's recommended to configure Structured Streaming jobs with the following job configuration:



- 

Retries: Set to Unlimited.
- 

Maximum concurrent runs: Set to 1. There must be only one instance of each query concurrently active.
- 

Cluster: Set this always to use a new job cluster and use the latest Spark version (or at least version 2.1). Queries started in Spark 2.1 and above are recoverable after query and Spark version upgrades.
- 

Notifications: Set this if you want email notification on failures.
- 

Schedule: Do not set a schedule.
- 

Timeout: Do not set a timeout. Streaming queries run for an indefinitely long time.
