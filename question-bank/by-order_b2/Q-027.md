# Question 27

## Question
A data engineer is designing a streaming ingestion pipeline using Auto Loader. The requirement is that the pipeline should never fail on schema changes but must capture any new columns that arrive in the data for later inspection.




Which configuration should the engineer use?

## Options
- A. none 
- B. addNewColumns 
- C. rescue (Correct)
- D. failOnNewColumns 

## Explanation
The `rescue` mode ensures that the schema does not evolve, so the stream will not fail if new columns are added. Instead, any new columns are stored in the rescued data column, allowing later inspection without interrupting the stream. This meets the requirement to keep the stream running without failures and still capture new schema elements.
