# Question 56

## Question
The data engineering team wants to know if the tables that they maintain in the Lakehouse are over-partitioned.




Which of the following is an indicator that a Delta Lake table is over-partitioned?

## Options
- A. If most partitions in the table have less than 1 GB of data (Correct)
- B. If the data in the table continues to arrive indefinitely. 
- C. If most partitions in the table have more than 1 GB of data 
- D. If the number of partitions in the table are too low 

## Explanation
Data that is over-partitioned or incorrectly partitioned will suffer greatly. Files cannot be combined or compacted across partition boundaries, so partitioned small tables increase storage costs and total number of files to scan. This leads to slowdowns for most general queries.




If most partitions in a table have less than 1GB of data, the table is likely over-partitioned
