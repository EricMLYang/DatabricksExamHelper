# Question 15

## Question
A data engineering team is working on a user activity events table stored in Unity Catalog. Queries often involve filters on multiple columns like user_id and event_date.




Which data layout technique should the team implement to avoid expensive table scans?

## Options
- A. Use partitioning on the event_date column. 
- B. Use Z-order indexing on the user_id 
- C. Use liquid clustering on the combination of user_id and event_date (Correct)
- D. Use partitioning on the user_id column, along with Z-order indexing on the event_date column. 

## Explanation
In this scenario, using liquid clustering on the combination of user_id and event_date is the best choice to avoid expensive scans. This technique incrementally optimizes data layout based on both columns, efficiently supporting filters on these columns and avoiding costly table scans.




Partitioning only on event_date helps queries filtering by date but doesn't optimize filtering by user_id, leading to potential full scans within partitions. Z-order indexing on user_id optimizes queries filtering on user_id but ignores event_date filtering, resulting in inefficient scans when filtering by date. Lastly, partitioning on user_id + Z-order on event_date supports filtering on both columns but can create many small partitions (if users are numerous), causing management and performance issues.
