# Question 18

## Question
A junior data engineer has created the table 'orders_backup' as a copy of the table "orders". Recently, the team started getting an error when querying the orders_backup indicating that some data files are no longer present. The transaction logs for the orders tables show a recent run of VACUUM command.




Which of the following explains how the data engineer created the orders_backup table ?

## Options
- A. The orders_backup table was created using Delta Lake's SHALLOW CLONE functionality from the orders table (Correct)
- B. The orders_backup table was created using CTAS statement from orders table 
- C. The orders_backup table was created using CRAS statement from orders table 
- D. The orders_backup table was created using Delta Lake's DEEP CLONE functionality from the orders table 

## Explanation
With Shallow Clone, you create a copy of a table by just copying the Delta transaction logs.

That means that there is no data moving during Shallow Cloning.

Running the VACUUM command on the source table may purge data files referenced in the transaction log of the clone. In this case, you will get an error when querying the clone indicating that some data files are no longer present.
