# Question 41

## Question
A data analyst at a retail company is responsible for generating daily reports on sales performance across multiple regions and product categories. The company ingests transaction data continuously from its online stores using Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines. The analyst needs to create a relational object that can efficiently precompute business-level aggregations, such as total revenue, average order value, and units sold per category, so that downstream reporting and dashboards can access the data quickly without recalculating it every time.




Which of the following objects is most suitable for this use case?

## Options
- A. Standard view 
- B. Temporary view 
- C. Materialized view (Correct)
- D. Streaming table 

## Explanation
The most suitable object for this use case is a materialized view because it allows the data analyst to precompute and store business-level aggregations, such as total revenue, average order value, and units sold per category, so that downstream reports and dashboards can access the results quickly without recalculating them every time, unlike a temporary or standard view, which either exist only for the session or require repeated recomputation, and unlike a streaming table, which is designed for processing raw, real-time event streams rather than pre-aggregated summaries.
