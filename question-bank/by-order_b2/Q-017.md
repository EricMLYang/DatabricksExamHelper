## Question
Which of the following statements regarding the retention policy of Delta lake CDF is correct?

## Options
- A. Running the VACUUM command on the table does not deletes CDF data 
- B. Running the VACUUM command on the table does not deletes CDF data unless CASCADE clause is set to true 
- C. Running the VACUUM command on the table deletes CDF data as well (Correct)
- D. CDF data files can be purged by running VACUUM CHANGES command 

## Explanation
Databricks records change data for UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE operations in the _change_data folder under the table directory.




The files in the _change_data folder follow the retention policy of the table. Therefore, if you run the VACUUM command, change data feed data is also deleted.
