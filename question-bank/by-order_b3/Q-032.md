# Question 32

## Question
The data engineering team has a large Delta table named 'users'. A recent query on the table returned some entries with negative values in the 'age' column.




To avoid this issue and enforce data quality, a junior data engineer decided to add a CHECK constraint to the table with the following command:




`ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT valid_age CHECK (age> 0);`




However, the command fails when executed.




Which statement explains the cause of this failure?

## Options
- A. The users table already contains rows that violate the new constraint; all existing rows must satisfy the constraint before adding it to the table. (Correct)
- B. The users table already exists; CHECK constraints can only be added during table creation using CREATE TABLE command. 
- C. The users table already contains rows; CHECK constraints can only be added on empty tables 
- D. The syntax for adding the CHECK constraint is incorrect. Instead, the command should be:

ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT ON COLUMN age (CHECK > 0) 

## Explanation
ADD CONSTRAINT command verifies that all existing rows in the table satisfy the constraint before adding it to the table. Otherwise, the command failed with an error that says some rows in the table violate the new CHECK constraint.
