# Question 11

## Question
Which of the following tools does Not allow data engineers to programmatically trigger a multi-task job run?

## Options
- A. Databricks SDKs 
- B. Workspace Jobs UI (Correct)
- C. REST API 
- D. Command-line interface (CLI) 

## Explanation
The Workspace Jobs UI does not allow data engineers to programmatically trigger a multi-task job run. It's a graphical interface that requires manual interaction and cannot be used for automated or code-based job execution.




While the REST API, Command-line interface (CLI), and Databricks SDKs all provide programmatic ways to run jobs.
