# Question 57

## Question
A data engineer has an existing Databricks job and wants to manage it using Databricks Asset Bundles. They want to use the Databricks CLI to get the YAML definition of the job and download its referenced artifacts.




Which of the following commands allows the data engineer to achieve this?

## Options
- A. databricks bundle clone job --existing-job-id 
- B. databricks bundle get job --existing-job-id 
- C. databricks bundle download job --existing-job-id 
- D. databricks bundle generate job --existing-job-id (Correct)

## Explanation
The correct command is `databricks bundle generate`, because it allows the data engineer to generate bundle configuration for a resource that already exists in your Databricks workspace. This process generates a YAML definition of a job, pipeline, app, or dashboard and automatically downloads any artifacts it references, such as notebooks.
