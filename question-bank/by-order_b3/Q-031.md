## Explanation
To enable Automatic Liquid Clustering on a Delta table in Databricks, two prerequisites are required:



- 

Table must be a Unity Catalog-managed table
- 

Automatic Liquid Clustering works only on tables managed by Unity Catalog. External tables are currently not supported.

- 

Table must have predictive optimization enabled
- 

Predictive optimization provides the system with insights on access patterns, which Liquid Clustering leverages to automatically optimize data layout.
