# Question 37

## Question
The data engineering team noticed that a partitioned Delta Lake table is suffering greatly. They are experiencing slowdowns for most general queries on this table.




The team tried to run an OPTIMIZE command on the table, but this did not help to resolve the issue.




Which of the following likely explains the cause of these slowdowns?

## Options
- A. They are applying the OPTIMIZE command on the whole table. It must be applied at each partition separately. 
- B. They are applying the OPTIMIZE command without ZORDER. Z-ordering is needed on the partitioning columns. 
- C. The table is over-partitioned or incorrectly partitioned. This requires a full rewrite of all data files to resolve the issue. (Correct)
- D. The table has too many old data files that need to be purged. They need to run a VACUUM command instead. 

## Explanation
Data that is over-partitioned or incorrectly partitioned will suffer greatly. Files cannot be combined or compacted across partition boundaries, so partitioned small tables increase storage costs and total number of files to scan. This leads to slowdowns for most general queries. Such an issue requires a full rewrite of all data files to remedy.
