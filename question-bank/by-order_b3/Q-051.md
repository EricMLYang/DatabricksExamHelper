# Question 51

## Question
"An object that physically stores precomputed query results, updating automatically or on a schedule to improve performance for complex aggregations and BI workloads"




Which of the following is being described in the above statement?

## Options
- A. Standard view 
- B. Temporary view 
- C. Streaming table 
- D. Materialized view (Correct)

## Explanation
The statement describes a materialized view. In Databricks SQL, materialized views are Unity Catalog managed tables that physically store the results of a query. Unlike standard views, which compute results on demand, materialized views cache the results and update them as the underlying source tables change; either on a schedule or automatically. By pre-computing expensive or frequently used queries, Materialized views lower query latency and resource consumption. This optimizes performance for complex aggregations and accelerate BI dashboard performance.




So, in summary, a materialized view has the following characteristics:
- 

Physically stores the results of a query.
- 

Can be refreshed automatically or on a schedule.
- 

Optimized for complex aggregations and business intelligence (BI) workloads.




Why other options are incorrect:
- 

Standard view: Does not store data physically; it's just a saved query.
- 

Temporary view: Exists only for the session and is not persistent.
- 

Streaming table: incrementally ingests data, but it's not for storing precomputed query results.
