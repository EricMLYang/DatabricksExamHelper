# Question 55

## Question
A data engineer from a global logistics company needs to share specific datasets and analysis notebooks with an external analytics vendor, who is a Databricks client. The data is stored as Delta tables in Unity Catalog, and the vendor does not have access to the company Databricks account.




What is the most effective and secure way to share the data and notebooks with the external vendor?

## Options
- A. Share the Delta tables and notebooks using Delta Sharing. (Correct)
- B. Share the Delta tables using Delta Sharing, and grant access to each notebook via its built-in collaboration feature. 
- C. Share the Delta tables using Delta Sharing, and publish the notebooks as HTML pages programmatically. 
- D. Share the Delta tables using Delta Sharing, and send all the notebooks together in a single DBC file. 

## Explanation
Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing enables secure, open, and real-time sharing of tables, notebooks, volumes, and ML models with other Databricks clients. This does not require them to have access to the same Databricks account or workspace. With Unity Catalog, the company can ensure fine-grained access control and governance. This approach is efficient, scalable, and adheres to enterprise-grade security standards.
