# Question 4

## Question
A team consisting of multiple data analysts wants to work on an analytics project that involves performing basic data exploration, querying small datasets, and running analyses using Python and SQL. They ask a data engineer to configure interactive clusters to support their workloads.




Which of the following cluster access modes should the engineer configure to best support this use case?

## Options
- A. SINGLE USER 
- B. DEDICATED 
- C. STANDARD (Correct)
- D. NO_ISOLATION_SHARED 

## Explanation
For a team of data analysts performing exploratory analysis, querying small datasets, and running Python and SQL workloads collaboratively, the STANDARD cluster access mode is the most suitable choice. Standard clusters are designed to provide shared access to the cluster resources for general workloads, providing cost-effective compute options while isolating users' workloads from each other. They efficiently handle Python and SQL workloads, and since the project does not involve specialized computations like R, MLlib, or RDD-based tasks, there is no need for the additional capabilities of Dedicated Access mode. This mode balances operational efficiency with simplicity, making it ideal for collaborative but non-specialized analytics tasks.




Other modes are less appropriate for this scenario. Dedicated Access is intended for specialized workloads or group-based secure collaboration, which is overkill for standard Python/SQL analytics. Single-user clusters, which are now part of Dedicated Access mode, are designed for isolated operational workloads, not team collaboration. No Isolation Shared clusters provide minimal data isolation and are generally discouraged for multi-user environments due to security concerns.




Therefore, configuring Standard mode clusters ensures the analysts can collaborate effectively while keeping the environment secure, efficient, and cost-effective.
