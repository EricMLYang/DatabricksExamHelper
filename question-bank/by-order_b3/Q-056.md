# Question 56

## Question
What is the primary purpose of Lakehouse Federation in data architecture?

## Options
- A. To optimize storage costs by compressing data 
- B. To enable direct querying across multiple data sources without migrating data (Correct)
- C. To create backups of data stored in Databricks 
- D. To migrate all data into Databricks for centralized processing 

## Explanation
Lakehouse Federation allows users and applications to run queries across diverse data sources—such as data lakes, warehouses, and databases—without requiring the physical migration of data into Databricks. This reduces data duplication, lowers latency, and streamlines access, enabling a unified query experience across distributed environments.
