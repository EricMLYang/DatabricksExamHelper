# Question 47

## Question
The data engineering team has a secret scope named 'DataOps-Prod' that contains all secrets needed by DataOps engineers in a production workspace.




Which of the following is the minimum permission required for the DataOps engineers to use the secrets in this scope?

## Options
- A. MANAGE permission on the "DataOps-Prod" scope 
- B. READ permission on each secret in the "DataOps-Prod" scope 
- C. READ permission on the "DataOps-Prod" scope (Correct)
- D. MANAGE permission on each secret in the "DataOps-Prod" scope 

## Explanation
The secret access permissions are as follows:



- 

MANAGE - Allowed to change ACLs, and read and write to this secret scope.
- 

WRITE - Allowed to read and write to this secret scope.
- 

READ - Allowed to read this secret scope and list what secrets are available.




Each permission level is a subset of the previous level's permissions (that is, a principal with WRITE permission for a given scope can perform all actions that require READ permission).
