# Question 3

## Question
A data scientist from the marketing department requires read-only access to the 'customer_insights' table located in the analytics schema, which is part of the BI catalog. The data will be used to generate quarterly customer engagement reports. In accordance with the principle of least privilege, only the minimum permissions necessary to perform the required tasks should be granted.




Which SQL commands will correctly grant access with the least privileges?

## Options
- A. ```

- GRANT SELECT ON TABLE bi.analytics.insights TO marketing_team;
- GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA bi.analytics TO marketing_team;
``` 
- B. ```

- GRANT SELECT ON TABLE bi.analytics.insights TO marketing_team;
- GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA bi.analytics TO marketing_team;
- GRANT USE CATALOG ON CATALOG bi TO marketing_team;
``` (Correct)
- C. ```

- GRANT SELECT ON TABLE bi.analytics.insights TO marketing_team; 
``` 
- D. ```

- GRANT SELECT ON TABLE bi.analytics.insights TO marketing_team;
- GRANT USE CATALOG ON CATALOG bi TO marketing_team;
``` 

## Explanation
To access a specific table, the user must be granted SELECT on the table itself, `USE SCHEMA` on the containing schema, and `USE CATALOG` on the parent catalog. This provides just enough access for read operations without overprovisioning.
