## Options
- A. It leverages advanced sampling strategies to randomize column selection after uniformly balancing data across all files. 
- B. It automatically determines optimal clustering keys based on the type and order of column definition in the schema. 
- C. It intelligently selects clustering keys from predefined clustering columns specified during table creation. 
- D. It leverages Predictive Optimization to choose optimal clustering keys based on observed query behavior. (Correct)

## Explanation
Automatic Liquid Clustering in Databricks is a feature designed to automatically optimize the physical layout of data in Delta tables based on the access patterns and metadata statistics. It leverages Predictive Optimization, which uses query behavior analytics to select clustering keys dynamically.
