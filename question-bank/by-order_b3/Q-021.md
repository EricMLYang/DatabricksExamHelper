# Question 21

## Question
The data engineering team at an analytics firm has started implementing Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines to process large-scale data transformation. During a routine code review session, the data engineering lead emphasizes a critical best practice: before performing any pipeline runs, the team must always click the "Validate" button in the notebook associated with the pipeline.




What is the main benefit of this practice?

## Options
- A. It executes the pipeline on a small dataset to preview the transformation results. 
- B. It runs unit tests on all pipeline components to verify their correctness. 
- C. It validates that the user has access permissions to create tables in the catalog. 
- D. It checks for any syntax errors in the pipeline code without actually processing data (Correct)

## Explanation
The "validate" option in the notebook identifies syntax or configuration errors in the pipeline definition before execution, reducing the risk of runtime failures or writing partial data.
