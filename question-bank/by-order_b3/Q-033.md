# Question 33

## Question
A data engineering team manages a multi-task job where each task may be retried multiple times. They noticed that job notifications are not sent when failed tasks are retried.




Which of the following configurations will ensure that a failure notification is received for every failed task?

## Options
- A. Use task-level notifications in the job definition (Correct)
- B. Implement custom notification logic within each task 
- C. Create a separate job for each task with job-level retries 
- D. Disable all task retries to rely on job-level notifications 

## Explanation
In a multi-task job, notifications can be configured at two levels:



- 

Job-level notifications: Trigger only when the entire job succeeds or fails.
- 

This means if an individual task fails but is retried successfully, no notification is sent until the overall job completes or fails.

- 

Task-level notifications: Trigger for each task event, including failures, or successful completions.








Configuring task-level notifications ensures a notification is sent for every failed task, even if it's later retried.
