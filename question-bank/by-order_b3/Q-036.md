# Question 36

## Question
A data engineering team has successfully established a new connection named mysql_connection in Databricks to connect to their external MySQL database. Their goal is to make the MySQL tables available and queryable through Unity Catalog by leveraging Lakehouse Federation, allowing downstream analytics teams to seamlessly access this data.




Given that the connection is already in place, the team now needs to take the next step to add the MySQL tables within Unity Catalog so that they can be queried in a governed and secure manner, consistent with their organization's data governance policies.




What is the next step the team should take to achieve this goal?

## Options
- A. Create a foreign catalog in Unity Catalog using the existing mysql_connection. (Correct)
- B. Create an external catalog with a default location defined via the existing mysql_connection. 
- C. Create an external table referencing MySQL data through the existing mysql_connection. 
- D. Set up a Unity Catalog metastore for MySQL using the existing mysql_connection. 

## Explanation
The next step the team should take is to create a foreign catalog in Unity Catalog using the existing mysql_connection, as Lakehouse Federation in Databricks allows Unity Catalog to register external data sources like MySQL as foreign catalogs. This makes the tables accessible and queryable in a governed, secure way without moving the data, which aligns with the team's goal.
