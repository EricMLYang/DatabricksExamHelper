- C. ```

- MERGE INTO orders
- USING new_orders
- ON orders.orders_id = new_orders.orders_id
- WHEN NOT MATCHED

``` (Correct)
- D. ```

- MERGE INTO orders
- USING new_orders
- ON orders.orders_id = new_orders.orders_id
- WHEN MATCHED
-     INSERT *
- WHEN NOT MATCHED
-     IGNORE *
``` 

## Explanation
The syntax for insert-only merge:



```

- MERGE INTO target_table
- USING soruce_table
- ON merge_condition
- WHEN NOT MATCHED
-     INSERT *
```





You just need to specify the NOT MATCHED clause, which inserts a row when a source row does not match any target row based on the merge_condition (merge keys). Records that have the same keys as an existing record in the table will be simply ignored.
