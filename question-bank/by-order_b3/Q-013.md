# Question 13

## Question
A data engineering team at a supply chain company uses Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines to manage inventory data. The team maintains an append-only streaming table, inventory_raw, that stores raw inventory status information, with columns: product_id, quantity, and event_timestamp.




A data engineer is tasked with creating a new table, inventory_latest, to capture near real-time changes in product inventory levels from inventory_raw. The new table will include the columns: product_id, current_quantity, and updated_timestamp.




Which of the following types of objects would be most suitable to implement the inventory_latest table?

## Options
- A. Live table 
- B. Temporary view 
- C. Materialized view 
- D. Streaming table (Correct)

## Explanation
The most suitable object to implement the inventory_latest table is a Streaming table, because it is designed to continuously capture and update near real-time changes from an append-only source like inventory_raw. Implementing inventory_latest as a Streaming table allows you to merge incoming changes or apply a CDC (Change Data Capture) feed from inventory_raw so that the table always reflects the latest inventory state per product_id. Each new event—whether an update or insertion—can be applied in real time, updating current_quantity and updated_timestamp without rebuilding the entire table, which is the main advantage over a materialized view or temporary view.




Materialized Views (formerly known as Live Tables) provide batch-oriented or scheduled incremental processing for precomputed queries rather than continuously updating individual records in real time. Temporary views, in contrast, are ephemeral and not suited for persistent state tracking.




Note: Databricks has recenlty open-sourced this solution, integrating it into the Apache Spark ecosystem under the name Spark Declarative Pipelines (SDP).
