# Question 6

## Question
During the setup of Delta Sharing with an external partner, a data engineer asks the partner for their sharing identifier.




Which of the following best describes the sharing identifier within the context of Databricks-to-Databricks Sharing?

## Options
- A. It acts as the authentication token for API calls with the recipient's endpoint 
- B. It provides a unique reference for the recipient's Unity Catalog metastore (Correct)
- C. It serves as a public encryption key used during data writes to the partner's tables 
- D. It identify the partner's network IP address for firewall whitelisting 

## Explanation
A Delta Sharing identifier is a unique string used in Databricks-to-Databricks sharing to identify a recipient's Unity Catalog metastore. This identifier allows the data provider to grant access to shared data.




The format of the sharing identifier is:

`<cloud>:<region>:<uuid>`




Example:

`aws:us-west-2:19a84bee-54bc-43a2-87de-023d0ec16016`




In this example:
- 

aws: represents the cloud provider (Amazon Web Services).
- 

us-west-2: represents the specific AWS region.
- 

19a84bee-54bc-43a2-87de-023d0ec16016: is the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) of the recipient's Unity Catalog metastore.




Recipients can obtain their sharing identifier from their Databricks workspace using Catalog Explorer or by running a SQL query like SELECT CURRENT_METASTORE();. This identifier is then provided to the data provider, who uses it to create a recipient and grant access to shares.
