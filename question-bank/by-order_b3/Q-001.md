# Question 1

## Question
A data engineer is using the following spark configurations in a pipeline to enable Optimized Writes and Auto Compaction:



```

- spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.optimizeWrite.enabled", True)
- spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.autoCompact.enabled", True)
```





They also want to enable Z-order indexing with Auto Compaction to leverage data skipping on all the pipeline's tables.




Which of the following solutions allows the data engineer to complete this task ?

## Options
- A. Use spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.autoZorder.enabled", True) 
- B. Z-order indexing with Auto Compaction can only be enabled on each table separately using:




ALTER TABLE table_name

SET TBLPROPERTIES (delta.autoOptimize.zorder.enabled = true) 
- C. There is no way to enable Z-order indexing with Auto Compaction since it does not support Z-Ordering (Correct)
- D. Use spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.autoCompact.zorder.enabled", True) 

## Explanation
Auto Compaction does not support Z-Ordering as Z-Ordering is significantly more expensive than just compaction.
