# Question 23

## Question
A data engineer has heard recently that users who have access to Databricks Secrets could be able to display the values of secrets in notebooks.




Which of the following could be a workaround to print the value of a Databricks secret in plain text?

## Options
- A. db_password = dbutils.secrets.get("prod-scope", "db-password", redacted=False)

print(db_password) 
- B. db_password = dbutils.secrets.get("prod-scope", "db-password")

display(db_password) 
- C. db_password = dbutils.secrets.get("prod-scope", "db-password")

print(db_password, redacted=False) 
- D. db_password = dbutils.secrets.get("prod-scope", "db-password")

for char in db_password:

       print(char) (Correct)

## Explanation
Databricks redacts secret values that are read using dbutils.secrets.get(). When displayed in notebook cell output, the secret values are replaced with [REDACTED] string.




However, is there a workaround to print the values of Databricks secrets in plain text by Iterating through the secret and printing each character.
