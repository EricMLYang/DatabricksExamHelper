# Question 22

## Question
A data engineer wants to use Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs) in a fully automated CI/CD pipeline on GitHub.




What is the recommended method for authenticating DABs to the target Databricks workspace in this scenario?

## Options
- A. Personal Access Token for a Databricks service principal 
- B. Personal Access Token for an administrator user 
- C. OAuth token federation for a Databricks service principal (Correct)
- D. OAuth client secret for a Databricks service principal 

## Explanation
Databricks Asset Bundles are a feature of the Databricks CLI. To enable the CLI to authenticate to Databricks without managing Databricks secrets, it's recommended to use OAuth token federation for a Databricks service principal in the target workspace.
