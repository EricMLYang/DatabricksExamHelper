# Question 54

## Question
"A Delta Lake's functionality that automatically compacts small files during individual writes to a table by performing two complementary operations on the table"




Which of the following is being described in the above statement?

## Options
- A. OPTIMIZE operation 
- B. Auto Optimize (Correct)
- C. Auto compaction 
- D. Optimized writes 

## Explanation
Auto Optimize is a functionality that allows Delta Lake to automatically compact small data files of Delta tables. This can be achieved during individual writes to the Delta table.




Auto optimize consists of 2 complementary operations:

- Optimized writes: with this feature enabled, Databricks attempts to write out 128 MB files for each table partition.

- Auto compaction: this will check after an individual write, if files can further be compacted. If yes, it runs an OPTIMIZE job with 128 MB file sizes (instead of the 1 GB file size used in the standard OPTIMIZE)
