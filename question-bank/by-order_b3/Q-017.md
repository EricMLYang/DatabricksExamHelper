Only department-specific columns in the table need to be shared, but with different names. In addition, there is some sensitive data that must be filtered out before sharing.




Which of the following objects can be created to meet the specified requirements ?

## Options
- A. A new Delta Table created using CTAS statement on the existing table 
- B. A new Delta Table created using SHALLOW CLONE from the existing table 
- C. A new Delta Table created using DEEP CLONE from the existing table 
- D. A stored view on the existing table (Correct)

## Explanation
The solution in this case is to create a view on the table where the required columns can be renamed, and the sensitive data that can be filtered out with the WHERE clause.
