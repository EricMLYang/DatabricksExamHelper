name STRING, category STRING, expiration_date DATE,  price FLOAT




When executing the below query:



```

- SELECT * FROM products
- WHERE price > 30.5
```





Which of the following will be leveraged by the query optimizer to identify the data files to load?

## Options
- A. Columns statistics in the Hive metastore 
- B. Files statistics in Unity Catalog metastore 
- C. Columns statistics in the metadata of Parquet files 
- D. Files statistics in the Delta transaction log (Correct)

## Explanation
In the Transaction log, Delta Lake captures statistics for each data file of the table. These statistics indicate per file:
- 

Total number of records
- 

Minimum value in each column of the first 32 columns of the table
- 

Maximum value in each column of the first 32 columns of the table
- 

Null value counts for in each column of the first 32 columns of the table




When a query with a selective filter is executed against the table, the query optimizer uses these statistics to generate the query result. it leverages them to identify data files that may contain records matching the conditional filter.




For the SELECT query in the question, The transaction log is scanned for min and max statistics for the price column.
