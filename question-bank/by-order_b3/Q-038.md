# Question 38

## Question
A data engineer has defined the following data quality constraint in a LDP pipeline:




`CONSTRAINT valid_id EXPECT (id IS NOT NULL) _____________`




Which clause correctly fills in the blank so records violating this constraint will be dropped, and reported in metrics?

## Options
- A. ON VIOLATION DELETE ROW 
- B. ON VIOLATION DROP ROW (Correct)
- C. ON VIOLATION FAIL UPDATE 
- D. ON VIOLATION DISCARD ROW 

## Explanation
The correct clause to fill in the blank is ON VIOLATION DROP ROW, so the full constraint becomes `CONSTRAINT valid_id EXPECT (id IS NOT NULL) ON VIOLATION DROP ROW`. This ensures that any record with a null id will be automatically dropped from the pipeline, while still being tracked in the pipeline's metrics, allowing the data engineer to monitor the number of violations without failing the entire job.




Note: Databricks has recenlty open-sourced this solution, integrating it into the Apache Spark ecosystem under the name Spark Declarative Pipelines (SDP).
