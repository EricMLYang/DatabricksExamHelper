DBU Cost is not part of Spark UI. DBU stands for Databricks Unit and it is a unit of processing capability per hour for pricing purposes. This depends on your cluster configuration which tells you how much DBUs would be consumed if a virtual machine runs for an hour, and then pays for each DBU consumed.
