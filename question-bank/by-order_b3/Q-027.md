# Question 27

## Question
The data engineering team has a Delta Lake table created with following query:



```

- CREATE TABLE customers_clone
- LOCATION 'dbfs:/mnt/backup'
- AS SELECT * FROM customers
```





A data engineer wants to drop the table with the following query:

`DROP TABLE customers_clone`




Which statement describes the result of running this drop command ?

## Options
- A. Only the table's metadata will be deleted from the catalog, while the data files will be kept in the storage (Correct)
- B. The table will not be dropped until VACUUM command is run 
- C. Both the table's metadata and the data files will be deleted 
- D. An error will occur as the table is shallowly cloned from the customers table 

## Explanation
External (unmanaged) tables are tables whose data is stored in an external storage path by using a LOCATION clause.

When you run DROP TABLE on an external table, only the table's metadata is deleted, while the underlying data files are kept.
