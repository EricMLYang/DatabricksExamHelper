# Question 44

## Question
A data engineer has a Job with multiple tasks that takes more than 2 hours to complete. In the last run, the final task unexpectedly failed.




Which of the following actions can the data engineer perform to complete this run while minimizing the execution time ?

## Options
- A. They need to delete the failed Run, and start a new Run for the Job 
- B. They can keep the failed Run, and simply start a new Run for the Job 
- C. They can rerun this Job Run to execute all the tasks 
- D. They can repair this Job Run so only the failed tasks will be re-executed (Correct)

## Explanation
You can repair failed multi-task jobs by running only the subset of unsuccessful tasks and any dependent tasks. Because successful tasks are not re-run, this feature reduces the time and resources required to recover from unsuccessful job runs.
