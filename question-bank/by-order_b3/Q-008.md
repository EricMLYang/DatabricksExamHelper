## Question
Which of the following Databricks CLI commands allows a data engineer to list all runs of a job that started at or after a specific time?

## Options
- A. databricks jobs list-runs --job-id <job-id> --time-from <time-value> 
- B. databricks jobs list-runs --job-id <job-id> --from <time-value> 
- C. databricks jobs list-runs --job-id <job-id> --start-time-from <time-value> (Correct)
- D. databricks jobs list-runs --job-id <job-id> --start <time-value> 

## Explanation
The correct Databricks CLI command that allows a data engineer to list all runs of a job that started at or after a specific time is `databricks jobs list-runs --job-id <job-id> --start-time-from <time-value>`, as `--start-time-from` is the proper parameter used to filter job runs based on their start time in the Databricks CLI.
