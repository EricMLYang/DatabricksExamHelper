# Question 26

## Question
The data engineering team has a Delta Lake table created with following query:



```
- CREATE TABLE target
- AS SELECT * FROM source
```





A data engineer wants to drop the source table with the following query:

`DROP TABLE source`




Which statement describes the result of running this drop command ?

## Options
- A. Only the source table will be dropped, but the target table will be no more queryable 
- B. Both the target and source tables will be dropped 
- C. An error will occur indicating that other tables are based on this source table 
- D. Only the source table will be dropped, while the target table will not be affected (Correct)

## Explanation
`CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` statements, or CTAS statements create new Delta tables and populate them using the output of a SELECT query. So, when dropping the source table, the target table will not be affected.
