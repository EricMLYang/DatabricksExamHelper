# Question 20

## Question
The data engineering team maintains a Type 1 table that is overwritten each night with new data received from the source system.




A junior data engineer has suggested enabling the Change Data Feed (CDF) feature on the table in order to identify those rows that were updated, inserted, or deleted.




Which response to the junior data engineer's suggestion is correct?

## Options
- A. CDF is useful when the table is a Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) of Type 2 
- B. CDF can not be enabled on existing tables. It can only be enabled on newly created tables. 
- C. CDF is useful when only a small fraction of records are updated in each batch (Correct)
- D. Table's data changes captured by CDF can only be read in streaming mode 

## Explanation
Generally speaking, we use CDF for sending incremental data changes to downstream tables in a multi-hop architecture. So, use CDF when only small fraction of records updated in each batch. Such updates are usually received from external sources in CDC format. If most of the records in the table are updated, or if the table is overwritten in each batch, like in the question, don't use CDF.




Here is some guidance for when to use CDF (from the below reference link)
