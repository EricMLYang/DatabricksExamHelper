# Question 24

## Question
A data engineer has added a CHECK constraint to the sales table using the following command:




`ALTER TABLE sales ADD CONSTRAINT valid_date CHECK (item_date >= '2024-01-01');`




In addition, they have added a comment on the item_date column using the following command:




`ALTER TABLE sales ALTER COLUMN item_date COMMENT "Date must be newer than Jan 1, 2024";`




Which of the following commands allows the data engineer to verify that both the constraint and the column comment have been successfully added on the table ?

## Options
- A. SHOW TBLPROPERTIES sales 
- B. DESCRIBE DETAIL sales 
- C. DESCRIBE TABLE sales 
- D. DESCRIBE EXTENDED sales (Correct)

## Explanation
`DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED` or simply `DESCRIBE EXTENDED` allows to show the added tables constraints in the 'Table Properties' field. It shows both the name and the actual condition of the check constraints.




In addition, `DESCRIBE EXTENDED` allows to show the comments on each column, and the comment on the table itself.
