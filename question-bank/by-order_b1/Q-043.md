# Question 43

## Question
Given the following code block in a notebook



```
- db_password = dbutils.secrets.get(scope="dev", key="database_password")
-  
- print (db_password)
```





Which statement describes what will happen when the above code is executed?

## Options
- A. The string value of the password will be printed in plain text. 
- B. The error message "Secrets can not be printed" will be shown 
- C. An interactive input box will appear in the notebook 
- D. The string "REDACTED" will be printed. (Correct)

## Explanation
Databricks Secrets allows you to securely store your credentials and reference them in notebooks and jobs. To prevent accidentally printing a secret to standard output buffers or displaying the value during variable assignment, Databricks redacts secret values that are read using dbutils.secrets.get(). When displayed in notebook cell output, the secret values are replaced with [REDACTED] string.
