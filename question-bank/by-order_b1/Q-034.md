# Question 34

## Question
A data engineering team at a retail company frequently collaborates with business analysts to generate insights from Unity Catalog tables. Over time, the analysts have reported confusion about several columns in key tables because the existing company documentation is outdated. To improve efficiency and reduce misinterpretation, the team lead recommends adding clear descriptions for all table columns. However, manually documenting hundreds of tables and columns would be time-consuming and likely to introduce inconsistencies.




Which of the following approaches allows the team to achieve this task automatically?

## Options
- A. Use Delta Lake generated columns to automatically create column descriptions based on existing data. 
- B. Use the AI-generated column comments feature in Unity Catalog Explorer. (Correct)
- C. Leverage Databricks Assistant to generate column descriptions, and apply them through ALTER TABLE commands. 
- D. Automate column documentation by creating tables through Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines. 

## Explanation
The Unity Catalog Explorer offers an AI-generated column comments feature. This functionality leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to automatically draft descriptive comments for columns based on their names, data types, sample values, and data patterns.
