# Question 30

## Question
A data engineer wants to create a Delta Lake table for storing user activities of a website. The table has the following schema:




user_id LONG, page STRING, activity_type LONG, ip_address STRING, activity_time TIMESTAMP, activity_date DATE




Based on the above schema, which column is a good candidate for partitioning the Delta Table?

## Options
- A. user_id 
- B. activity_type 
- C. activity_time 
- D. activity_date (Correct)

## Explanation
When choosing partitioning columns, it's good to consider the fact that records with a given value (the activities of a given user) will continue to arrive indefinitely. In such a case, we use a datetime column for partitioning. This allows your partitions to be optimized, and allows you to easily archive those partitions of previous time periods, if necessary.
