# Question 29

## Question
A data engineer has a Delta Lake table "products" with Change Data Feed (CDF) enabled. They want to share this table with external recipients using Delta Sharing, allowing the recipients to:



- 

Use the table_changes() function to consume incremental changes.
- 

Perform time travel queries on the table.




Which of the following commands should the data engineer run to achieve this?

## Options
- A. ALTER SHARE sales_share ADD TABLE products WITH TIME TRAVEL; 
- B. ALTER SHARE sales_share ADD TABLE products WITH (CDF AND TIME TRAVEL); 
- C. ALTER SHARE sales_share ADD TABLE products WITH HISTORY; (Correct)
- D. ALTER SHARE sales_share ADD TABLE products WITH CDF; 

## Explanation
In Databricks Delta Sharing, adding a table with history allows external recipients to both perform time travel queries and access Change Data Feed, if it's enabled. The WITH HISTORY option automatically exposes the complete table directory, enabling CDF consumption and historical queries.
