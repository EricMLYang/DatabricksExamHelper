# Question 23

## Question
A data engineer is cleaning a DataFrame orders and wants to calculate new columns using chained transformations:



```
- def normalize_email(df):
-     return df.withColumn("email", col("email").lower())
-  
- def calculate_total(df):
-     return df.withColumn("total_amount", col("quantity") * col("unit_price"))
-  
- orders_transformed = orders.transform(normalize_email).transform(calculate_total)
```





What is the key advantage of using the transform function in this scenario?

## Options
- A. It converts the DataFrame to an RDD before transformations. 
- B. It ensures transformations run in parallel on multiple nodes automatically. 
- C. It allows for modular, composable, and testable transformations. (Correct)
- D. It automatically caches the DataFrame after each transformation. 

## Explanation
The key advantage of using the transform function in this scenario is that it allows for modular, composable, and testable transformations, because transform lets you apply reusable functions to a DataFrame in a clean, chainable way, making each transformation self-contained and easier to maintain, test, and combine, without affecting execution parallelism.
