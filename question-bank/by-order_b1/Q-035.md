# Question 35

## Question
A healthcare organization stores sensitive patient data within Databricks Unity Catalog. They need to share this data with an external analytics vendor, who does not use Databricks.




What is the most secure and efficient method to enable this data access?

## Options
- A. Using Delta Sharing with the open sharing protocol (Correct)
- B. Storing the data in an external table for direct access 
- C. Downloading the data as protected Excel files and uploading them via SFTP 
- D. Creating a database stored view for external use 

## Explanation
Delta Sharing is designed to securely share data across platforms using an open protocol. Since the vendor does not use Databricks, Delta Sharing ensures secure, real-time access without manual exports or third-party workarounds.
