# Question 10

## Question
A data engineer has a Delta Lake table named 'orders_archive' created using the following command:



```
- CREATE TABLE orders_archive
- DEEP CLONE orders
```





They want to sync up the new changes in the orders table to the clone.




Which of the following commands can be run to achieve this task ?

## Options
- A. SYNC orders_archive 
- B. INSERT OVERWRITE orders_archive

SELECT * FROM orders 
- C. REFRESH orders_archive 
- D. CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE orders_archive

DEEP CLONE orders (Correct)

## Explanation
Cloning can occur incrementally. Executing the `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` command can sync changes from the source to the target location.

Now, If you run `DESCRIBE HISTORY orders_archive`, you will see a new version of CLONE operation occurred on the table.




* The last choice in the question is incorrect since dropping the table will lead to removing all the table's history.
