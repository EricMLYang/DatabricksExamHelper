# Question 2

## Question
A data engineering team at a large analytics company is working on improving data governance and cataloging across their Databricks environment. As part of this initiative, the lead data engineer is tasked with applying descriptive tags to several tables in the company's Delta Lake to make data discovery and management easier. While reviewing documentation, the engineer encounters multiple SQL command formats for setting tags on tables in Databricks and wants to confirm which command syntax is valid.




Which of the following is Not a correct command to set tags on a table in Databicks?

## Options
- A. ALTER TABLE table_name SET TAG tag_key = tag_value; (Correct)
- B. ALTER TABLE table_name SET TAGS ('tag_key1' = 'tag_value1', 'tag_key2' = 'tag_value2'); 
- C. SET TAG ON TABLE table_name tag_key = tag_value; 
- D. SET TAG ON TABLE table_name tag_key; 

## Explanation
In Databricks SQL, there are two forms to set tags on tables:



- 

The plural form using ALTER TABLE ... SET TAGS (...), which allows setting or one or multiple tags at once:

`ALTER TABLE table_name SET TAGS ('tag_key1' = 'tag_value1', 'tag_key2' = 'tag_value2');`

`ALTER TABLE table_name SET TAGS ('tag_key' = 'tag_value');`



- 

The singular form using SET TAG ON TABLE ... which is used to set individual tags.

`SET TAG ON TABLE table_name tag_key = tag_value;`




Notice that the tag_value is an optional identifier. If not specified, the tag assignment will be set as key-only.

`SET TAG ON TABLE table_name tag_key;`
