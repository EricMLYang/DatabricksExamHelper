# Question 50

## Question
Which of the following is the benefit of Delta Lake File Statistics?

## Options
- A. They are used as checksums to check data corruption in parquet files. 
- B. They are leveraged for data skipping when executing selective queries. (Correct)
- C. They are leveraged for process time forecasting when executing selective queries. 
- D. They are leveraged for data compression in order to improve Delta Caching. 

## Explanation
Delta Lake File Statistics indicate per file:
- 

Total number of records
- 

Minimum value in each column of the first 32 columns of the table
- 

Maximum value in each column of the first 32 columns of the table
- 

Null value counts for in each column of the first 32 columns of the table




These statistics are leveraged for data skipping based on query filters. For example, if you are querying the total number of records in a table, Delta will not calculate the count by scanning all data files. Instead, it will leverage these statistics to generate the query result
