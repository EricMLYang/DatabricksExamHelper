# Question 33

## Question
A data engineering team is discussing the optimal data layout strategy on a growing managed Delta table in Unity Catalog. They are considering partitioning, Z-ordering, and Liquid Clustering to improve query performance.




Which scenario best indicates that Automatic Liquid Clustering is the recommended choice?

## Options
- A. The table experiences diverse, frequently changing query filters across multiple columns, with unpredictable access patterns. (Correct)
- B. None of the listed options are correct. Automatic Liquid Clustering can not be applied on managed tables. 
- C. The table is heavily filtered by a consistent, small set of date ranges. 
- D. The team has identified stable clustering keys for the table. 

## Explanation
Automatic Liquid Clustering is designed to dynamically adapt to evolving and unpredictable query patterns by continuously reorganizing data based on recent query filters. This is especially beneficial when query predicates frequently change across multiple columns, making static strategies like partitioning or Z-ordering less effective.




Partitioning works best when filters are stable and predictable, often on date/time columns. Z-ordering optimizes clustering for known high-cardinality columns with consistent filtering. When query filters are varied and unpredictable, Automatic Liquid Clustering provides the agility to improve performance without manual tuning.
