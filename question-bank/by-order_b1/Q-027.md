# Question 27

## Question
A data engineer is working on a project where they need to integrate data from an external API into a Databricks workspace. For security reasons, they do not want to hardcode the API Key directly in their notebooks. Instead, they want to use Databricks Secrets to securely store and manage sensitive credentials.




Which Databricks CLI commands should they use to accomplish this goal?

## Options
- A. ```
- databricks secrets create-secret api_secrets
- databricks secrets put-scope api_key api_secrets
``` 
- B. ```
- databricks secrets create-scope api_scope
- databricks secrets put-secret api_key api_scope
``` 
- C. ```
- databricks secrets create-secret api_secrets
- databricks secrets put-scope api_secrets api_key
``` 
- D. ```
- databricks secrets create-scope api_scope
- databricks secrets put-secret api_scope api_key
``` (Correct)

## Explanation
The correct Databricks CLI commands to securely store a secret in Databricks Secrets are:




1- Create a new secret scope:

`databricks secrets create-scope SCOPE`




2- Add a secret to that scope

`databricks secrets put-secret SCOPE KEY`




This approach ensures that sensitive credentials are managed securely without hardcoding them in notebooks.
