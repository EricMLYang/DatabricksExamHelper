# Question 9

## Question
A data engineer claims that if they grant SELECT on the HR catalog to a reporting team, the team will automatically have SELECT access to any new tables or views added to the catalog next month. The engineer argues that this approach will save time because they won't have to grant access for each new table or view individually.




What is the accuracy of this claim?

## Options
- A. True, because grants at the catalog level apply to current and future objects in the catalog. (Correct)
- B. True, but only for tables, not views. 
- C. True, but only for views, not tables. 
- D. False, new tables and views must be granted SELECT privileges separately. 

## Explanation
With the Unity Catalog inheritance model, you can grant a user the SELECT privilege on a catalog or schema, which automatically grants the user SELECT privilege on all current and future tables, and views in the catalog or schema.
