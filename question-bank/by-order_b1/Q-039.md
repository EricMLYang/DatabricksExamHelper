# Question 39

## Question
Given the following multi-task job







If there is an error in the notebook 2 that is associated with Task 2, which statement describes the run result of this job ?

## Options
- A. Tasks 1 and 3 will succeed, while Task 2 will partially fail (Correct)
- B. Task 1 will succeed. Task 2 will partially fail. Task 3 will be skipped 
- C. Task 1 will succeed. Task 2 will completely fail. Task 3 will be skipped 
- D. Tasks 1 and 3 will succeed, while Task 2 will completely fail 

## Explanation
If a task fails during a job run, only the dependent tasks, if any, will be skipped. Parallel tasks will run and complete.




The failure of a task will always be partial, which means that the operations in the notebook before the code failure will be successfully run and committed, while the operations after the code failure will be skipped.
