# Question 49

## Question
A data engineer is analyzing demographic segments from a Delta table named customers, which stores millions of customer records including personal details such as customer_id, name, birth_date, email, and country. The team wants to create a "senior customer" segment for a marketing campaign targeting customers born on or before January 1, 1970. The engineer writes the following query:



```
- SELECT *
- FROM customers
- WHERE birth_date <= '1970-01-01';
```





However, the table has not been partitioned on the birth_date column and no Z-Order indexing has been applied.




Given this setup, what will most likely happen in terms of query performance?

## Options
- A. The query will perform a full table scan, reading all data files from storage. (Correct)
- B. The query will only read table metadata since it contains all column statistics. 
- C. The query will skip most files since dynamic file pruning is enabled by default. 
- D. The query will leverage data skipping since the filter column is among the first 32 columns. 

## Explanation
For a large, un-optimized table without partitioning or Z-Ordering on the filter column, the data related to different birth dates is likely scattered across many files, forcing the engine to read all, or almost all, table files.
