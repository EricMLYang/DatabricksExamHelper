# Question 55

## Question
A data analytics firm uses Delta Sharing to collaborate with a partner company. The provider stores the data in AWS US-East-1, while the partner is hosted on Azure in Europe. After initiating large-scale data sharing, the firm notices unexpected costs in their billing dashboard.




What is the most likely reason for the unexpected cost increase?

## Options
- A. DBU costs for running Delta Sharing servers across cloud boundaries 
- B. Storage costs because Delta Sharing requires replication of data across clouds and regions 
- C. Egress fees are incurred when data transferred between cloud providers and regions (Correct)
- D. Flat rate fee is applied for all shared data by Delta Sharing protocol 

## Explanation
When data is transferred out of your cloud infrastructure to another cloud platform or to another geographic region, your cloud provider applies "data egress fees". These fees can be significant depending on the volume of data transferred. Delta Sharing itself does not add substantial cost, but the underlying cloud provider's data transfer pricing—especially egress charges—is the primary contributor to cost increases in such scenarios.




In this scenario, AWS applies egress fees because data is transferred out of AWS to a different cloud provider (Azure) and to another geographic region (Europe).
