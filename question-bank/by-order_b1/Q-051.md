# Question 51

## Question
A data engineer has been tasked with creating a Unity Catalog table containing customer information, including email addresses and phone numbers, across multiple regions. The organization wants to ensure that users can query the table, but personally identifiable information (PII) is not exposed to those without proper access.




Which method should the engineer use to efficiently enforce this requirement?

## Options
- A. Apply column masks to configure fine-grained access control (Correct)
- B. Use table object privileges to revoke access on sensitive PII columns 
- C. Use a dynamic view to redacting sensitive PII columns 
- D. Use row-level filters to restrict access to region-specific customers 

## Explanation
Column masks in Unity Catalog are security features that dynamically control the visibility of sensitive data in specific columns based on the identity or role of the user executing a query. Implemented as SQL user-defined functions (UDFs), column masks replace or transform the original column values at query runtime, ensuring that unauthorized users see redacted or anonymized data.




For example, a masking function might display full Social Security Numbers (SSNs) only to users in the Human Resources department, while showing masked values like ***-**-**** to others. These masks are applied declaratively using the MASK clause:



```
- CREATE FUNCTION mask_ssn(ssn STRING)
- RETURN CASE WHEN is_member('hr_team')
- THEN ssn ELSE '***-**-****' END;
-  
- CREATE TABLE persons(name STRING, ssn STRING MASK mask_ssn);
```





Why other options are incorrect:



- 

Use a dynamic view to mask sensitive PII columns

While dynamic views can be used for masking, column-level masking in Unity Catalog is more efficient and built-in for this purpose. Dynamic views require creating and maintaining additional views manually.



- 

Use table object privileges to revoke access on sensitive PII columns

table object privileges control access to entire tables, not specific columns. This would prevent access entirely rather than selectively hiding PII.



- 

Use row-level filters to restrict access to region-specific customers

Row-level filtering controls which rows a user sees, but it does not protect specific columns (like emails or phone numbers) from unauthorized users.
