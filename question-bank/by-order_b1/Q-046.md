# Question 46

## Question
Which statement regarding streaming state in Stream-Stream Joins is correct?

## Options
- A. Spark buffers past inputs as a streaming state only for the right input stream, so that it can match future left inputs with past right inputs. 
- B. Spark buffers past inputs as a streaming state for both input streams, so that it can match every future input with past inputs. (Correct)
- C. Stream-Stream Joins are not stateful. Spark does not buffers past inputs as a streaming state for the input streams 
- D. Spark buffers past inputs as a streaming state only for the left input stream, so that it can match future right inputs with past left inputs. 

## Explanation
When performing stream-stream join, Spark buffers past inputs as a streaming state for both input streams, so that it can match every future input with past inputs. This state can be limited by using watermarks.
