Question 117
A data engineer, User A, has promoted a pipeline to production by using the REST API to programmatically create several jobs. A DevOps engineer, User B, has configured an external orchestration tool to trigger job runs through the REST API. Both users authorized the REST API calls using their personal access tokens.
A workspace admin, User C, inherits responsibility for managing this pipeline. User C uses the Databricks Jobs UI to take "Owner" privileges of each job. Jobs continue to be triggered using the credentials and tooling configured by User B.
An application has been configured to collect and parse run information returned by the REST API. Which statement describes the value returned in the creator_user_name field?
A. Once User C takes "Owner" privileges, their email address will appear in this field; prior to this, User A's email address will appear in this field. B. User B's email address will always appear in this field, as their credentials are always used to trigger the run. C. User A's email address will always appear in this field, as they still own the underlying notebooks. D. Once User C takes "Owner" privileges, their email address will appear in this field; prior to this, User B's email address will appear in this field. E. User C will only ever appear in this field if they manually trigger the job, otherwise it will indicate User B.

(補充說明)：此題在社群中存在爭議。一般而言，creator_user_name 在 Job Run 的 context 中通常指觸發該次執行的使用者。若是由 User B 透過 REST API 使用其 Token 觸發，理論上應顯示 User B (或對應的 Service Principal)。然而資料來源中的官方答案標記為 C，暗示該欄位可能在此情境下反映了 Job 的原始建立者或其他邏輯，或者題目考點在於所有權移轉對歷史紀錄或 API 回傳值的特定行為。建議實際考試時以官方邏輯為主，但需留意實務上的差異。
