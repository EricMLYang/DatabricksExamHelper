## 題目內容

### 題幹

A data engineer, User A, has promoted a new pipeline to production by using the REST API to programmatically create several jobs.

A DevOps engineer, User B, has configured an external orchestration tool to trigger job runs through the REST API.

Both users authorized the REST API calls using their personal access tokens.

Which statement describes the contents of the workspace audit logs concerning these events?

### 選項

- **A.** Because the REST API was used for job creation and triggering runs, a Service Principal will be automatically used to identify these events.
- **B.** Because User B last configured the jobs, their identity will be associated with both the job creation events and the job run events.
- **C.** Because these events are managed separately, User A will have their identity associated with the job creation events and User B will have their identity associated with the job run events.
- **D.** Because the REST API was used for job creation and triggering runs, user identity will not be captured in the audit logs.
- **E.** Because User A created the jobs, their identity will be associated with both the job creation events and the job run events.
