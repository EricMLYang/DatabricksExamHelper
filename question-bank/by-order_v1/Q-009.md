## 題目內容

### 題幹

A junior member of the data engineering team is exploring the language interoperability of Databricks notebooks. The intended outcome of the below code is to register a view of all sales that occurred in countries on the continent of Africa that appear in the geo_lookup table. Before executing the code, running SHOW TABLES on the current database indicates the database contains only two tables: geo_lookup and sales.

Cmd 1 (Python):

```python
countries_af = [x[0] for x in spark.table("geo_lookup").filter("continent = 'AF'").select("country").collect()]
```

Cmd 2 (SQL):

```sql
CREATE VIEW sales_af AS
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE city IN countries_af
AND CONTINENT = 'AF'
```

Which statement correctly describes the outcome of executing these command cells in order in an interactive notebook?

### 選項

- **A.** Both commands will succeed. Executing show tables will show that countries_af and sales_af have been registered as views.
- **B.** Cmd 1 will succeed. Cmd 2 will search all accessible databases for a table or view named countries_af; if this entity exists, Cmd 2 will succeed.
- **C.** Cmd 1 will succeed and Cmd 2 will fail. countries_af will be a Python variable representing a PySpark DataFrame.
- **D.** Both commands will fail. No new variables, tables, or views will be created.
- **E.** Cmd 1 will succeed and Cmd 2 will fail. countries_af will be a Python variable containing a list of strings.
