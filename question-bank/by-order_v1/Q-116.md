## 題目內容

Question 116
The data engineering team is configuring environments for development, testing, and production before beginning migration on a new data pipeline. The team requires extensive testing on both the code and data resulting from code execution, and the team wants to develop and test against data as similar to production data as possible.
A junior data engineer suggests that production data can be mounted to the development and testing environments, allowing pre-production code to execute against production data. Because all users have admin privileges in the development environment, the junior data engineer has offered to configure permissions and mount this data for the team.
Which statement captures best practices for this situation?
A. All development, testing, and production code and data should exist in a single, unified workspace; creating separate environments for testing and development complicates administrative overhead. B. In environments where interactive code will be executed, production data should only be accessible with read permissions; creating isolated databases for each environment further reduces risks. C. As long as code in the development environment declares USE dev_db at the top of each notebook, there is no possibility of inadvertently committing changes back to production data sources. D. Because Delta Lake versions all data and supports time travel, it is not possible for user error or malicious actors to permanently delete production data; as such, it is generally safe to mount production data anywhere. E. Because access to production data will always be verified using passthrough credentials, it is safe to mount data to any Databricks development environment.
Correct Answer: B

(分析補充)：此題考查 Databricks 環境隔離與資料存取的最佳實踐。在非生產環境（如開發環境）中，雖然開發者需要存取類似生產環境的資料進行測試，但為了防止意外修改或刪除生產資料，必須嚴格限制僅能以「唯讀（Read-Only）」權限存取生產資料，並且最好將各環境的資料庫（Database/Schema）進行隔離。選項 B 準確描述了這一點。選項 A 建議單一工作區會增加風險；選項 D 雖然提到 Time Travel，但它不能防止惡意或意外的永久刪除（如 VACUUM 操作）；選項 E 則忽略了即便有憑證驗證，若權限配置不當（如題目中提到的 Junior Engineer 配置），仍存在寫入風險。
