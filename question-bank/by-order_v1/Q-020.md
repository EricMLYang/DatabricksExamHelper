## 題目內容

### 題幹

A data architect has designed a system in which two Structured Streaming jobs will concurrently write to a single bronze Delta table.

Each job is subscribing to a different topic from an Apache Kafka source, but they will write data with the same schema.

To keep the directory structure simple, a data engineer has decided to nest a checkpoint directory to be shared by both streams.

The proposed directory structure is displayed below:

```
/bronze/checkpoint/delta_log/year_week=2020_01/year_week=2020_02
```

Which statement describes whether this checkpoint directory structure is valid for the given scenario and why?

### 選項

- **A.** No; Delta Lake manages streaming checkpoints in the transaction log.
- **B.** Yes; both of the streams can share a single checkpoint directory.
- **C.** No; only one stream can write to a Delta Lake table.
- **D.** Yes; Delta Lake supports infinite concurrent writers.
- **E.** No; each of the streams needs to have its own checkpoint directory.
