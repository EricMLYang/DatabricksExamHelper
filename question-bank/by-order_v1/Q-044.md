## 題目內容

### 題幹

The data governance team is reviewing code used for deleting records for compliance with GDPR.

They note the following logic is used to delete records from the Delta Lake table named users.

```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE user_id IN
  (SELECT user_id FROM delete_requests)
```

Assuming that user_id is a unique identifying key and that delete_requests contains all users that have requested deletion, which statement describes whether successfully executing the above logic guarantees that the records to be deleted are no longer accessible and why?

### 選項

- **A.** Yes; Delta Lake ACID guarantees provide assurance that the DELETE command succeeded fully and permanently purged these records.
- **B.** No; the Delta cache may return records from previous versions of the table until the cluster is restarted.
- **C.** Yes; the Delta cache immediately updates to reflect the latest data files recorded to disk.
- **D.** No, the Delta Lake DELETE command only provides ACID guarantees when combined with the MERGE INTO command.
- **E.** No; files containing deleted records may still be accessible with time travel until a VACUUM command is used to remove invalidated data files.
