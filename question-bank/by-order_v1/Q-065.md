## 題目內容

### 題幹

Two of the most common data locations on Databricks are the DBFS root storage and external object storage mounted with dbutils.fs.mount().

Which of the following statements is correct?

### 選項

- **A.** DBFS is a file system protocol that allows users to interact with files stored in object storage using syntax and guarantees similar to Unix file systems.
- **B.** By default, both the DBFS root and mounted data sources are only accessible to workspace administrators.
- **C.** The DBFS root is the most secure location to store data, because mounted storage volumes must have full public read and write permissions.
- **D.** Neither the DBFS root nor mounted storage can be accessed when using %sh in a Databricks notebook.
- **E.** The DBFS root stores files in ephemeral block volumes attached to the driver, while mounted directories will always persist saved data to external storage between sessions.
